* Pandoc  (*for compiling RMarkdown documents*)  
* RTools  (*for building packages for R*)  


### TinyTex {.tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> TinyTex </h3>

See [https://yihui.org/tinytex/](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)  

To install from R:  

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()

```


### Pandoc {.tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> Pandoc </h3>

Pandoc is a document converter, a separate software from R. **It comes bundled with RStudio.** It helps the process of converting Rmarkdown documents to formats like .pdf and adding complex functionality.  


### RTools {.tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> TinyTex </h3>

RTools is a collection of software for building packages for R

Install from this website: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)  




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## RStudio {#rstudio .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h2> RStudio </h2>


### RStudio Orientation
**First, open RStudio.** As their icons can look very similar, be sure you are opening *RStudio* and not R.  


For RStudio to function you must also have R installed on the computer (see [this section](#install) for installation instructions).  

**RStudio** is an interface (GUI) for easier use of **R**. You can think of R as being the engine of a vehicle, doing the crucial work, and RStudio as the body of the vehicle (with seats, accessories, etc.) that helps you actually use the engine to move forward!  

By default RStudio displays four rectangle panes. 

```{r basics_RStudio, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "RStudio_overview.png"))
```


<span style="color: black;">**_TIP:_** If your RStudio displays only one left pane it is because you have no scripts open yet.</span>


**The R Console Pane**  

The R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R "engine". This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. You can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script.  

If you are familiar with Stata, the R Console is like the Command Window and also the Results Window.

**The Source Pane**  
This pane, by default in the upper-left, is space to edit and run your scripts. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.  

For Stata users, this pane is similar to your Do-file and Data Editor windows.


**The Environment Pane**  
This pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These [objects](#objects) could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined (e.g. a specific epi week for the analysis), or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis (e.g. names of regions). Click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.  

In Stata, this is most similar to Variables Manager window.


**Plots, Packages, and Help Pane**  
The lower-right pane includes several tabs including plots (display of graphics including maps), help, a file library, and available R packages (including installation/update options).  

This pane contains the Stata equivalents of the Plots Manager and Project Manager windows.

### RStudio settings  

Change RStudio settings and appearance in the Tools drop-down menu, by selecting Global Options



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Scripts {#scripts .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h2> Scripts </h2>

Scripts are a fundamental part of programming. Storing your code in a script (vs. typing in the console) has many advantages:  

* Reproducibility  
* Version control  
* Commenting  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Rmarkdown {#rmd .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> Rmarkdown </h3>

Rmarkdown is a type of script in which the script itself *becomes* a document (PDF, Word, HTML, Powerpoint, etc.). See the handbook page on Rmarkdown documents.  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### R notebooks {#rnotebooks .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> R notebooks </h3>

There is no difference between writing in a Rmarkdown vs an R notebook. However the execution of the document differs slightly. See this [site](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook) for more details.

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### R Shiny {#shinyscripts .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h3> R Shiny </h3>

Shiny apps are contained within one script, which must be named `app.R`. This file has three components:  

1) A user interface (ui)  
2) A server function  
3) A call to the `shinyApp` function  

See the handbook page on Shiny basics, or this online tutorial: [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)

*In older versions, the above file was split into two files (`ui.R` and `server.R`)*

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Working directory {#workingdirectory}
<h2> Working directory </h2>

These tabs cover how to use R working directories, and how this changes when you are working within an R project. 
**The working directory is the root file location used by R for your work.**  
By default, it will save new files and outputs to this location, and will look for files to import (e.g. datasets) here as well.  

```
NOTE: If using an [R project](#rproject), the working directory will default to the R project root folder **IF** you open RStudio by clicking open the R project (the file with .rproj extension))

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Set by command

Use the command `setwd()` with the filepath in quotations, for example: `setwd("C:/Documents/R Files")`


<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** If using an RMarkdown script be aware of the following:</span>

In an [R Markdown](#rmarkdown) script, the default working directory is the folder the Rmarkdown file (`.Rmd`) is saved to. If you want to change this, you can use `setwd()` as above, but know the change will only apply to that specific code chunk.  

To change the working directory for all code chunks in an R markdown, edit the setup chunk to add the `root.dir = ` parameter, such as below:

```{r, eval=F}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'desired/filepath/here')
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Set Manually

Setting your working directory manually (point-and-click)  

From RStudio click: Session / Set Working Directory / Choose Directory (you will have to do this each time you open RStudio)


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### In an R project

How things change in an R project




<h2> Objects </h2>
<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Objects {#objects .tabset .tabset-fade }

Everything in R is an object. These sections will explain:  

* How to create objects (`<-`) 
* Types of objects (e.g. data frames, vectors..)  
* How to access subparts of objects (e.g. variables in a dataset)  
* Classes of objects (e.g. numeric, character, factor)  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Everything is an object 
<h3> Everything is an object </h3>

Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are **objects** which are **assigned a name** and **can be referenced** in later commands.  

An object exists when you have assigned it a value (see the assignment section below). When it is assigned a value, the object appears in the Environment (see the upper right pane of RStudio). It can then be operated upon, manipulated, changed, and re-defined.

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Defining objects (`<-`)
<h3> Defining objects </h3>

**Create objects *by assigning them a value* with the <- operator.**  
You can think of the assignment operator `<-` as the words "is defined as". Assignment commands generally follow a standard order:
 
**object_name**  <-  **value** (or process/calculation that produce a value)

> **EXAMPLE:** You may want to record the current epidemiological reporting week as an object for reference in later code. In this example, the object `reporting_week` is created when it is assigned the character value `"2018-W10"` (the quote marks make these a character value).  
The object `reporting_week` will then appear in the RStudio Environment pane (upper-right) and can be referenced in later commands.  


See the R commands and their output in the boxes below. 

```{r basics_objects_assignment}
reporting_week <- "2018-W10"   # this command creates the object reporting_week by assigning it a value
reporting_week                 # this command prints the current value of reporting_week object in the console
```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** Note the `[1]` in the R console output is simply indicating that you are viewing the first item of the output</span>


<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** **An object's value can be over-written** at any time by running an assignment command to re-define its value. Thus, the **order of the commands run is very important**.</span>

The following command will re-define the value of `reporting_week`: 

```{r basics_objects_reassignment}
reporting_week <- "2018-W51"   # assigns a NEW value to the object reporting_week
reporting_week                 # prints the current value of reporting_week in the console
```

**Datasets are also objects and must be assigned names when they are imported.**  

In the code below, the object `linelist` is created and assigned the value of a CSV file imported with the **rio** package.  

```{r basics_objects_dataframes, eval=FALSE}
# linelist_raw is created and assigned the value of the imported CSV file
linelist <- rio::import("my_linelist.csv")
```

You can read more about importing and exporting datasets with the section on [importing data](#importdata).

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** A quick note on naming of objects:</span>

  * Object names must not contain spaces, but you should use underscore (_) or a period (.) instead of a space.  
  * Object names are case-sensitive (meaning that Dataset_A is different from dataset_A). 
  * Object names must begin with a letter (cannot begin with a number like 1, 2 or 3). 

 

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Object structure {#objectstructure}  
<h3> Object structure </h3>

**Objects can be a single piece of data (e.g. `my_number <- 24`), or they can consist of structured data.**  

The graphic below, sourced from [this online R tutorial](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html) shows some common data structures and their names. Not included in this image is spatial data, which is discussed in the [GIS section](#gis).  


```{r basics_objects_structures, echo=F, out.width = "75%", out.height="50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "R_data_structures.png"))
```  

In epidemiology (and particularly field epidemiology), you will *most commonly* encounter data frames and vectors:  


Common structure | Explanation | Example from templates
------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------  
Vectors | A container for a sequence of singular objects, all of the same class (e.g. numeric, character). | **"Variables" (columns) in data frames are vectors** (e.g. the variable `age_years`).  
Data Frames | Vectors (e.g. columns) that are bound together that all have the same number of rows. | `linelist_raw` and `linelist_cleaned` are both data frames.  

Note that to create a vector that "stands alone", or is not part of a data frame (such as a list of location names), the function `c()` is often used:  
`list_of_names <- c("Ruhengeri", "Gisenyi", "Kigali", "Butare")`  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Object classes  {#objectclasses}
<h3> Object classes </h3>

All the objects stored in R have a *class* which tells R how to handle the object. There are many possible classes, but common ones include:

Class |	Explanation | Examples
------ | ------------------------------------------ |  -----------------------------
Character	| These are text/words/sentences **"within quotation marks"**. Math cannot be done on these objects.	| "Character objects are in quotation marks"  
Numeric	| These are numbers and **can include decimals**. If within quotation marks the will be considered character. | 23.1 or 14  
Integer | Numbers that are **whole only** (no decimals) | -5, 14, or 2000  
Factor | These are vectors that have a **specified order** or hierarchy of values | Variable `msf_involvement` with ordered values N, S, SUB, and U.  
Date | **Once R is told that certain data are Dates**, these data can be manipulated and displayed in special ways. See the page on Dates for more information. | 2018-04-12 or 15/3/1954 or Wed 4 Jan 1980  
Logical | Values must be one of the two special values TRUE or FALSE (note these are **not** "TRUE" and "FALSE" in quotation marks) | TRUE or FALSE  
data.frame | A data frame is how R stores a **typical dataset**. It consists of vectors (columns) of data bound together, that all have the same number of observations (rows). | The example AJS dataset named `linelist_raw` contains 68 variables with 300 observations (rows) each.  

**You can test the class of an object by feeding it to the function `class()`**. Note: you can reference a specific column within a dataset using the `$` notation to separate the name of the dataset and the name of the column.

```{r basics_objects_class, echo=TRUE, eval=T}
class(linelist$age)     # class should be numeric

class(linelist$gender)  # class should be character
```

**Often, you will need to convert objects or variables to another class.**

Function | Action  
----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------    
`as.character()` | Converts to character class  
`as.numeric()` | Converts to numeric class  
`as.integer()` | Converts to integer class
`as.Date()` | Converts to Date class - Note: see section on [dates](#dates) for details  
`as.factor()` | Converts to factor - Note: re-defining order of value levels requires extra arguments

Here is [more online material on classes and data structures in R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/13-supp-data-structures/).


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Columns/Variables (`$`) {#dollarsign}  
<h3> Columns/Variables </h3>

**Vectors within a data frame (variables in a dataset) can be called, referenced, or created using the `$` symbol.** The `$` symbol connects the name of the column to the name of its data frame. The `$` symbol must be used, otherwise R will not know where to look for or create the column.  

In this handbook, we use the word "column" instead of "variable".  


```{r basics_objects_call, eval=F}
# Retrieve the length of the vector age_years
length(linelist$age) # (age is a variable in the linelist data frame)

```

By typing the name of the data frame followed by `$` you will also see a list of all variables in the data frame. You can scroll through them using your arrow key, select one with your Enter key, and avoid spelling mistakes!  

```{r basics_objects_callGIF, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "Calling_Names.gif"))
```  



<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_ADVANCED TIP:_** Some more complex objects (e.g. an `epicontacts` object may have multiple levels which can be accessed through multiple dollar signs. For example `epicontacts$linelist$date_onset`) .</span>



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Access with brackets (`[]`) {#brackets}  
<h3> Access with brackets (`[]`) </h3>

You may need to view parts of objects, which is often done using the square brackets `[ ]`.  

To view specific rows and columns of a dataset, you can do this using the syntax `dataframe[rows, columns]`:  

```{r basics_objects_access, eval=F}
# View a specific row (2) from dataset, with all columns
linelist[2,]

# View all rows, but just one column
linelist[, "date_onset"]

# View values from row 2 and columns 5 through 10
linelist[2, 5:10] 

# View values from row 2 and columns 5 through 10 and 18
linelist[2, c(5:10, 18)] 

# View rows 2 through 20, and specific columns
linelist[2:20, c("date_onset", "outcome", "age")]

# View rows and columns based on criteria
# *** Note the dataframe must still be names in the criteria!
linelist[linelist$age > 25 , c("date_onset", "date_birth", "age")]

# Use View() to see the outputs in the RStudio Viewer pane (easier to read) 
# *** Note the capital "V" in View() function
View(linelist[2:20, "date_onset"])

# Save as a new object
new_table <- linelist[2:20, c("date_onset")] 
```

The square brackets also work to call specific parts of an object, such as output of a `summary()` function, or a vector: 

```{r}
# All of the summary
summary(linelist$age)

#Just one part
summary(linelist$age)[2]  

my_vector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f")  # define the vector
my_vector[5]                                  # print the 5th element
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Functions and packages {#functions .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h2> Functions and packages </h2>


This section on functions explains:  

* What a function is and how they work  
* What arguments are  
* What packages are  
* How to get help understanding a function  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Simple functions  
<h3> Simple functions </h3>

**A function is like a machine that receives inputs, does some action with those inputs, and produces an output.**  
What the output is depends on the function.    

**Functions typically operate upon some object placed within the function's parentheses**. 
For example, the function `sqrt()` calculates the square root of a number:  

```{r basics_function_sqrt}
sqrt(49)
```

Functions can also be applied to variables in a dataset. For example, when the function `summary()` is applied to the numeric variable `age` in the dataset `linelist` ([what's the `$` symbol?](#objects)), the output is a summary of the variable's numeric and missing values.

```{r basics_functions_summary}
summary(linelist$age)
```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** Behind the scenes, a function represents complex additional code that has been wrapped up for the user into one easy command.</span>



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Functions with multiple arguments  
<h3> Functions with multiple arguments </h3>

Functions often ask for several inputs, called ***arguments***, located within the parentheses of the function, usually separated by commas. 

* Some arguments are required for the function to work correctly, others are optional.  
* Optional arguments have default settings if they are not specified.
* Arguments can take character, numeric, logical (TRUE/FALSE), and other inputs.  


```{r basics_functions_image, echo=F, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "Function_Bread_Example.png"))
```


>**For example**, this `age_pyramid()` command produces an age pyramid graphic based on defined age groups and a binary split variable, such as `gender`. The function is given three arguments within the parentheses, separated by commas. The values supplied to the arguments establish `linelist` as the data frame to use, `age_group` as the variable to count, and `gender` as the binary variable to use for splitting the pyramid by color.

```{r basics_functions_arguments, include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T}
## create an age group variable by specifying categorical breaks
linelist$age_group <- cut(linelist$age, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60))
```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** For this example, in the background we have created a new variable called "age_group". To learn how to create new variable see [that section of this handbook](#newvars) </span>


```{r basics_functions_pyramid, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=T, out.width = "75%", out.height="75%"}
# Creates an age pyramid by specifying the dataframe, age group variable, and a variable to split the pyramid
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist, age_group = "age_group", split_by = "gender")
```

> The first half of an argument assignment (e.g. `data = `) does not need to be specified if the arguments are written in a specific order (specified in the function's documentation). The below code produces the exact same pyramid as above, because the function expects the argument order: data frame, `age_group` variable, `split_by` variable.  

```{r, basics_functions_pyramid2, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, , out.width = "75%", out.height="75%", eval=F}
# This command will produce the exact same graphic as above
apyramid::age_pyramid(linelist, "age_group", "gender")
```

**A more complex `age_pyramid()` command might include the *optional* arguments to:**  

* Show proportions instead of counts (set `proportional = TRUE` when the default is `FALSE`)  
* Specify the two colors to use (`pal = ` is short for "palette" and is supplied with a vector of two color names. See the [objects](#objectstructure) page for how the function `c()` makes a vector)  


<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** For arguments specified with an equals symbol (e.g. `coltotals = ...`), their order among the arguments is not important (must still be within the parentheses and separated by commas).</span>


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = "75%", out.height="75%"}
age_pyramid(linelist, "age_group", "gender", proportional = TRUE, pal = c("orange", "purple"))
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Packages {#packages}  
<h3> Packages </h3>

**Packages contain functions.**  

On installation, R contains "base" functions that perform common elementary tasks. But many R users create specialized functions, which are verified by the R community and which you can download as a **package** for your own use.  

One of the more challenging aspects of R is that there are often many functions or packages to choose from to complete a given task.  

*Functions* are contained within **packages** which can be downloaded ("installed") to your computer from the internet. Once a package is downloaded, you access its functions by loading the package with the `library()` command at the beginning of each R session.

```{r basics_packages_load, eval=F}
# this loads the package "tidyverse" for use in the current R session
library(tidyverse)
```

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** While you only have to install a package once, you must load it at the beginning of every R session using `library()` command, or an alternative like **pacman**'s `p_load()` function.</span>

Think of R as your personal library: When you download a package your library gains a book of functions, but each time you want to use a function in that book, you must borrow that book from your library.  

For clarity in this handbook, functions are usually preceeded by the name of their package using the `::` symbol in the following way:  

`package_name::function_name()`  

Once a package is loaded for a session, this explicit style is not necessary. One can just use `function_name()`. However giving the package name is useful when a function name is common and may exist in multiple packages (e.g. `plot()`).  
Using the package name will also load the package if it is not already loaded.
 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# This command uses the package "rio" and its function "import()" to import a dataset
linelist <- rio::import("linelist.xlsx", which = "Sheet1")
```

**Dependencies**  
Packages often depend on other packages, and these are called "dependencies". When a package is installed from CRAN, it will typically also install its dependenices.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->

<h3> Function help </h3>

To read more about a function, you can try searching online for resources OR search in the Help tab of the lower-right RStudio pane.

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Piping (`%>%`) {#piping .tabset .tabset-fade}
<h2> Piping (`%>%`) </h2> 

**Two general approaches to R coding are:**  

1) **Tidyverse** - *piping* an object from function to function  
2) **Define intermediate objects** - an older method, yet still worth knowing  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### **Pipes** 
<h3> Pipes </h3>  

**Simply explained, the pipe operator (`%>%`) passes an intermediate output from one function to the next.**  
You can think of it as saying "then". Many functions can be linked together with `%>%`.  

* Piping emphasizes a sequence of actions, not the object the actions are being performed on  
* Best when a sequence of actions must be performed on one object  

* from **magrittr**. Included in **dplyr** and **tidyverse**
* Makes code more clean and easier to read, intuitive
* express a sequence of operations  
* the object is altered and then passed on to the next function  

Example:

```{r piping_example_pipe, eval=F}
# A fake example of how to bake a care using piping syntax

cake <- flour %>%       # to define cake, start with flour, and then...
  left_join(eggs) %>%   # add eggs
  left_join(oil) %>%    # add oil
  left_join(water) %>%  # add water
  mix_together(utensil = spoon, minutes = 2) %>%                # mix together
  bake(degrees = 350, system = "fahrenheit", minutes = 35) %>%  # bake
  let_cool()            # let it cool down
```

https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/pipes/#:~:text=Pipes%20are%20an%20extremely%20useful,code%20and%20combine%20multiple%20operations.

Piping is not a base function. To use piping, the **dplyr** package must be installed and loaded. Near the top of every template script is a code chunk that installs and loads the necessary packages, including **dplyr**. You can [read more about piping in the documentation](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/).

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** Remember that even when using piping to link functions, if the assignment operator (`<-`) is present, the object to the left will still be over-written (re-defined) by the right side.</span>

TODO
%<>% shortcut for re-defining the object and piping

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Define intermediate objects
<h3> Define intermediate objects </h3>  

Better if:  

* You need to manipulate multiple objects  
* There are intermediate steps that are meaningful and deserve separate object names

as changes are made - 
still handy to know

Risks: creating new objects for each step - lots of objects. If you use the wrong one you might not know.
naming can be confusing,
errors not easily detectable

either name each intermediate object, or overwrite the original, or combine all the functions together. all come with risks

https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html

```{r piping_example_redefine, eval=F}
# a fake example of how to bake a cake using this method (defining intermediate objects)
batter_1 <- left_join(flour, eggs)
batter_2 <- left_join(batter_1, oil)
batter_3 <- left_join(batter_2, water)

batter_4 <- mix_together(object = batter_3, utensil = spoon, minutes = 2)

cake <- bake(batter_4, degrees = 350, system = "fahrenheit", minutes = 35)

cake <- let_cool(cake)
```

Combine all functions together - also difficult to read
```{r piping_example_wide, eval=F}
# an example of combining/nesting mutliple functions together - difficult to read
cake <- let_cool(bake(mix_together(batter_3, utensil = spoon, minutes = 2), degrees = 350, system = "fahrenheit", minutes = 35))
```

## Key operators and functions {#operators .tabset .tabset-fade }
<h2> Key operators and functions </h2>

This section details operators in R, such as:  

* Relational operators (less than, equal too..)  
* Logical operators (and, or...)  
* Handling missing values  
* Mathematical operators and functions (+/-, >, sum(), median(), ...)  
* The `%in%` operator

**Relational operators compare values** and are often used when defining new variables and subsets of datasets. Here are the common relational operators in R:  

Function                |Operator     |Example       |Example Result
------------------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------
Equal to                |`==`         |`"A" == "a"`  |`FALSE` (because R is case sensitive) *Note that == (double equals) is different from = (single equals), which acts like the assignment operator `<-`*
Not equal to            |`!=`         |`2 != 0`      |`TRUE`
Greater than            |`>`          |`4 > 2`       |`TRUE`
Less than               |`<`          |`4 < 2`       |`FALSE`
Greater than or equal to|`>=`         |`6 >= 4`      |`TRUE`
Less than or equal to   |`<=`         |`6 <= 4`      |`FALSE`
Value is missing        |`is.na()`    |`is.na(7)`    |`FALSE` (see section on missing values)
Value is not missing    |`!is.na()`   |`!is.na(7)`   |`TRUE`

**Logical operators, such as AND and OR, are often used to connect relational operators and create more complicated criteria**. Complex statements might require parentheses ( ) for grouping and order of application.  

Function   |Operator
-----------|------------------------
AND        |`&`
OR         |`|` (vertical bar)
Parentheses|`( )` Used to group criteria together and clarify order


For example, below, we have a linelist with two variables we want to use to create our case definition, `hep_e_rdt`, a test result and `other_cases_in_hh`, which will tell us if there are other cases in the household. The command below uses the function `case_when()` to create the new variable `case_def` such that:

```{r basics_operators_casewhen, eval=FALSE}
linelist_cleaned <- linelist_cleaned %>%
  mutate(case_def = case_when(
    is.na(hep_e_rdt) & is.na(other_cases_in_hh)           ~ NA_character_,
    hep_e_rdt == "Positive"                               ~ "Confirmed",
    hep_e_rdt != "Positive" & other_cases_in_hh == "Yes"  ~ "Probable",
    TRUE                                                  ~ "Suspected"
  ))
```

Criteria in example above               | Resulting value in new variable "case_def"
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
If the value for variables `hep_e_rdt` and `other_cases_in_hh` are missing | `NA` (missing)  
If the value in `hep_e_rdt` is "Positive" | "Confirmed"  
If the value in `hep_e_rdt` is NOT "Positive" AND the value in `other_cases_in_hh` is "Yes" | "Probable"  
If one of the above criteria are not met | "Suspected"  


*Note that R is case-sensitive, so "Positive" is different than "positive"...*

### Missing values
<h3> Missing values </h3>

**In R, missing values are represented by the special value `NA`** (capital letters N and A - not in quotation marks). If you import data that records missing data in another way (e.g. 99, "Missing", or .), you may want to re-code those values to `NA`.
  
**To test whether a value is `NA`, use the special function `is.na()`**, which returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r basics_operators_missing}
rdt_result <- c("Positive", "Suspected", "Positive", NA)   # two positive cases, one suspected, and one unknown
is.na(rdt_result)  # Tests whether the value of rdt_result is NA
```

To DO:
SECTION ON OTHER `NA` TYPES: `NA_character`, `NA_real` etc.
SECTION ON `NULL`

### Mathematics and statistics  
<h3> Mathematics and statistics </h3>

All the operators and functions in this page is automatically available using **base** R.  

#### Mathematical operators  

These are often used to perform addition, division, to create new columns, etc. Below are common mathematical operators in R. Whether you put spaces around the operators is not important.  


Objective          |Example in R
-------------------|-------------
addition           | 2 + 3
subtraction        | 2 - 3
multiplication     | 2 * 3
division           | 30 / 5
exponent           | 2^3
order of operations| ( )



#### Mathematical functions

Objective          |Function
-------------------|-------------
rounding           | round(x, digits = n)
ceiling (round up) | ceiling(x)
floor (round down) | floor(x)
absolute value     | abs(x)
square root        | sqrt(x)
exponent           | exponent(x)
natural logarithm  | log(x)



#### Statistical functions:  

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** The functions below will by default include missing values in calculations. Missing values will result in an output of NA, unless the argument `na.rm=TRUE` is specified</span>


Objective                |Function
-------------------------|----------------------
mean (average)           | mean(x, na.rm=T)
median                   | median(x, na.rm=T)
standard deviation       | sd(x, na.rm=T)
quantiles*               | quantile(x, probs)
sum                      | sum(x, na.rm=T)
minimum value            | min(x, na.rm=T)
maximum value            | max(x, na.rm=T)
range of numeric values  | range(x, na.rm=T)
summmary**               | summary(x)

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** If providing a vector of numbers to one of the above functions, be sure to wrap the numbers within `c()` .</span>

```{r}
# If supplying raw numbers to a function, wrap them in c()
mean(1, 6, 12, 10, 5, 0)    # !!! INCORRECT !!!  

mean(c(1, 6, 12, 10, 5, 0)) # CORRECT
```

*`quantile()`: x is the numeric vector to examine, and probs is a numeric vector with probabilities within 0 and 1.0, e.g `c(0.5, 0.8, 0.85)`

**`summary()`: gives a summary on a numeric vector including mean, median, and common percentiles



#### Other useful functions:  


Objective                   |Function            |Example
----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------
create a sequence           | seq(from, to, by)  |`seq(1, 10, 2)`
repeat x, n times           | rep(x, ntimes)     |`rep(1:3, 2)` or `rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 3)` 
subdivide a numeric vector  | cut(x, n)          |`cut(linelist$age, 5)`


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### `%in%`  
<h3> `%in%` </h3>

A very helpful operator 

```{r}
my_vector <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
"a" %in% my_vector
"h" %in% my_vector
```

To ask if a value is **not** `%in%`, put an exclamation mark (!) **in front** of the logic statement:  

```{r}
# to negate, put an exclamation in front
!"a" %in% my_vector
!"h" %in% my_vector
```

`%in%` is very useful when using the **dplyr** function `case_when()` to recode values in a column. For example:  

```{r eval=F}
linelist <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = case_when(
    hospital %in% c("St. Fr.", "Saint Francis") ~ "St. Francis")) # convert to correct spelling
```

## Errors & Warnings {.tabset .tabset-fade }
<h2> Errors & Warnings </h2>

This section explains:  

* General syntax for writing R code  
* Code assists  
* the difference between errors and warnings  

Common errors and warnings and their solutions can be found in X section (TODO).
See the handbook page on common errors and warnings.  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Errors and Warnings  
<h3> Errors and warnings </h3>

When a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.  

* A **warning** means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps or produced unusual output that you should be aware of.  

* An **error** means that R was not able to complete your command.  

Look for clues: 

* The error/warning message will often include a line number for the problem.  

* If an object "is unknown" or "not found", perhaps you spelled it incorrectly, forgot to call a package with library(), or forgot to re-run your script after making changes.  

If all else fails, copy the error message into Google along with some key terms - chances are that someone else has worked through this already!


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### General syntax tips
<h3> General syntax tips </h3>

A few things to remember when writing commands in R, to avoid errors and warnings:  

* Always close parentheses - tip: count the number of opening "(" and closing parentheses ")" for each code chunk
* Avoid spaces in column and object names. Use underscore ( _ ) or periods ( . ) instead
* Keep track of and remember to separate a function's arguments with commas
* R is case-sensitive, meaning `Variable_A` is *different* from `variable_A`


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Code assists  
<h3> Code assists </h3>

Any script (RMarkdown or otherwise) will give clues when you have made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to write a comma where it is needed, or to close a parentheses, RStudio will raise a flag on that line, on the right side of the script, to warn you.
