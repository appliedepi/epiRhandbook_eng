# Directory interactions { }  

In this page we cover common scenarios where you create, interact with, save, and import with directories (folders).  


## Preparation  

### **fs** package {.unnumbered}  

The **fs** package is a **tidyverse** package that facilitate directory interactions, improving on some of the **base** R functions. In the sections below we will often use functions from **fs**.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  fs,             # file/directory interactions
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # relative file pathways
  tidyverse)      # data management and visualization
```


### Print directory as a dendrogram tree {.unnumbered}  

Use the function `dir_tree()` from **fs**.  

Provide the folder filepath to `path = ` and decide whether you want to show only one level (`recurse = FALSE`) or all files in all sub-levels (`recurse = TRUE`). Below we use `here()` as shorthand for the R project and specify its sub-folder "data", which contains all the data used for this R handbook. We set it to display all files within "data" and its sub-folders (e.g. "cache", "epidemic models", "population", "shp", and "weather").  


```{r}
fs::dir_tree(path = here("data"), recurse = TRUE)
```


## List files in a directory  

To list just the file names in a directory you can use `dir()` from **base** R. For example, this command lists the file names of the files in the "population" subfolder of the "data" folder in an R project. The relative filepath is provided using `here()` (which you can read about more in the [Import and export] page).  

```{r}
# file names
dir(here("data", "gis", "population"))
```

To list the full file paths of the directory's files, you can use you can use `dir_ls()` from **fs**. A **base** R alternative is `list.files()`.  

```{r}
# file paths
dir_ls(here("data", "gis", "population"))
```

To get all the metadata information about each file in a directory, (e.g. path, modification date, etc.) you can use `dir_info()` from **fs**.  

This can be particularly useful if you want to extract the last modification time of the file, for example if you want to import the most recent version of a file. For an example of this, see the [Import and export] page.     

```{r, eval=F}
# file info
dir_info(here("data", "gis", "population"))
```

Here is the data frame returned. Scroll to the right to see all the columns.  

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(dir_info(here("data", "gis", "population")), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

## File information  

To extract metadata information about a specific file, you can use `file_info()` from **fs** (or `file.info()` from **base** R).  

```{r, eval=F}
file_info(here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(file_info(here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds")), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Here we use the `$` to index the result and return only the `modification_time` value.  

```{r}
file_info(here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))$modification_time
```




## Check if exists  

### R objects {.unnumbered}  

You can use `exists()` from **base** R to check whether an R object exists *within* R (supply the object name in quotes).  

```{r}
exists("linelist")
```

Note that some **base** R packages use generic object names like "data" behind the scenes, that will appear as TRUE unless `inherit = FALSE` is specified. This is one reason to not name your dataset "data".  

```{r}
exists("data")
exists("data", inherit = FALSE)
```

If you are writing a function, you should use `missing()` from **base** R to check if an argument is present or not, instead of `exists()`.  



### Directories {.unnumbered}  

To check whether a directory exists, provide the file path (and file name) to `is_dir()` from **fs**. Scroll to the right to see that `TRUE` is printed.    

```{r}
is_dir(here("data"))
```

An alternative is `file.exists()` from **base** R.  


### Files {.unnumbered}  

To check if a specific file exists, use `is_file()` from **fs**. Scroll to the right to see that `TRUE` is printed.  

```{r}
is_file(here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

A **base** R alternative is `file.exists()`.  



## Create  

### Directories {.unnumbered}  

To create a new directory (folder) you can use `dir_create()` from **fs**. If the directory already exists, it will not be overwritten and no error will be returned. 

```{r, eval=F}
dir_create(here("data", "test"))
```

An alternative is `dir.create()` from **base** R, which will show an error if the directory already exists. In contrast, `dir_create()` in this scenario will be silent.  

### Files {.unnumbered}  

You can create an (empty) file with `file_create()` from **fs**. If the file already exists, it will not be over-written or changed.  

```{r, eval=F}
file_create(here("data", "test.rds"))
```

A **base** R alternative is `file.create()`. But if the file already exists, this option will truncate it. If you use `file_create()` the file will be left unchanged.  


### Create if does not exists {.unnumbered}  

UNDER CONSTRUCTION  


## Delete

### R objects {.unnumbered}  

Use `rm()` from **base** R to remove an R object.  

### Directories {.unnumbered}  

Use `dir_delete()` from **fs**. 


### Files {.unnumbered}  

You can delete files with `file_delete()` from **fs**.  



## Running other files  

### `source()` {.unnumbered}  

To run one R script from another R script, you can use the `source()` command (from **base** R).

```{r, eval=F}
source(here("scripts", "cleaning_scripts", "clean_testing_data.R"))
```

This is equivalent to viewing the above R script and clicking the "Source" button in the upper-right of the script. This will execute the script but will do it silently (no output to the R console) unless specifically intended. See the page on [Interactive console] for examples of using `source()` to interact with a user via the R console in question-and-answer mode.  

```{r, fig.align = "center", out.height = '300%', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "source_button.png"))
```


### `render()` {.unnumbered}  

`render()` is a variation on `source()` most often used for R markdown scripts. You provide the `input = ` which is the R markdown file, and also the `output_format = ` (typically either "html_document", "pdf_document", "word_document", "") 

See the page on [Reports with R Markdown] for more details. Also see the documentation for `render()` [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/reference/render.html) or by entering `?render`.  



### Run files in a directory {.unnumbered}

You can create a *for loop* and use it to `source()` every file in a directory, as identified with `dir()`. 

```{r, eval=F}
for(script in dir(here("scripts"), pattern = ".R$")) {   # for each script name in the R Project's "scripts" folder (with .R extension)
  source(here("scripts", script))                        # source the file with the matching name that exists in the scripts folder
}
```

If you only want to run certain scripts, you can identify them by name like this:  

```{r, eval=F}

scripts_to_run <- c(
     "epicurves.R",
     "demographic_tables.R",
     "survival_curves.R"
)

for(script in scripts_to_run) {
  source(here("scripts", script))
}

```



Here is a [comparison](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fs/vignettes/function-comparisons.html) of the **fs** and **base** R functions.  

### Import files in a directory  {.unnumbered}

See the page on [Import and export] for importing and exporting individual files.  

Also see the [Import and export] page for methods to automatically import the most recent file, based on a date in the file name *or* by looking at the file meta-data.  

See the page on [Iteration, loops, and lists] for an example with the package **purrr** demonstrating:  

* Splitting a data frame and saving it out as multiple CSV files  
* Splitting a data frame and saving each part as a separate sheet within one Excel workbook  
* Importing multiple CSV files and combining them into one dataframe  
* Importing an Excel workbook with multiple sheets and combining them into one dataframe  




## **base** R  

See below the functions `list.files()` and `dir()`, which perform the same operation of listing files within a specified directory. You can specify `ignore.case =` or a specific pattern to look for. 

```{r, eval=F}
list.files(path = here("data"))

list.files(path = here("data"), pattern = ".csv")
# dir(path = here("data"), pattern = ".csv")

list.files(path = here("data"), pattern = "evd", ignore.case = TRUE)

```

If a file is currently "open", it will display in your folder with a tilde in front, like "~$hospital_linelists.xlsx".
