This analysis plots the frequency of different **combinations** of values/responses. In this example, we plot the frequency at which cases exhibited various combinations of symptoms.  

This analysis is also often called:  

* **"Multiple response analysis"**  
* **"Sets analysis"**  
* **"Combinations analysis"**  

In the example plot above, five symptoms are shown. Below each vertical bar is a line and dots indicating the combination of symptoms reflected by the bar above. To the right, horizontal bars reflect the frequency of each individual symptom.  

The first method we show uses the package **ggupset**, and the second uses the package **UpSetR**.

## Preparation {  }

### Load packages {.unnumbered}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,     # data management and visualization
  UpSetR,        # special package for combination plots
  ggupset)       # special package for combination plots
```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Import data {.unnumbered}  


To begin, we import the cleaned linelist of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export] page for details).  



```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist_sym <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import case linelist 
linelist_sym <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```


This linelist includes five "yes/no" variables on reported symptoms. We will need to transform these variables a bit to use the **ggupset** package to make our plot. View the data (scroll to the right to see the symptoms variables).  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist_sym, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Re-format values {.unnumbered}  

To align with the format expected by **ggupset** we convert the "yes" and "no" the the actual symptom name, using `case_when()` from **dplyr**. If "no", we set the value as blank, so the values are either `NA` or the symptom.  
 

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create column with the symptoms named, separated by semicolons
linelist_sym_1 <- linelist_sym %>% 

  # convert the "yes" and "no" values into the symptom name itself
  # if old value is "yes", new value is "fever", otherwise set to missing (NA)
mutate(fever = ifelse(fever == "yes", "fever", NA), 
       chills = ifelse(chills == "yes", "chills", NA),
       cough = ifelse(cough == "yes", "cough", NA),
       aches = ifelse(aches == "yes", "aches", NA),
       vomit = ifelse(vomit == "yes", "vomit", NA))
```

Now we make two final columns:  

1. Concatenating (gluing together) all the symptoms of the patient (a character column)  
2. Convert the above column to class *list*, so it can be accepted by **ggupset** to make the plot  

See the page on [Characters and strings] to learn more about the `unite()` function from **stringr**

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
linelist_sym_1 <- linelist_sym_1 %>% 
  unite(col = "all_symptoms",
        c(fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit), 
        sep = "; ",
        remove = TRUE,
        na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    # make a copy of all_symptoms column, but of class "list" (which is required to use ggupset() in next step)
    all_symptoms_list = as.list(strsplit(all_symptoms, "; "))
    )
```

View the new data. Note the two columns towards the right end - the pasted combined values, and the list

```{r, echo=F, , warning=F, message=F}
DT::datatable(head(linelist_sym_1,50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## **ggupset** {  }

Load the package

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggupset)
```


Create the plot. We begin with a `ggplot()` and `geom_bar()`, but then we add the special function `scale_x_upset()` from the **ggupset**.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = linelist_sym_1,
  mapping = aes(x = all_symptoms_list)) +
geom_bar() +
scale_x_upset(
  reverse = FALSE,
  n_intersections = 10,
  sets = c("fever", "chills", "cough", "aches", "vomit"))+
labs(
  title = "Signs & symptoms",
  subtitle = "10 most frequent combinations of signs and symptoms",
  caption = "Caption here.",
  x = "Symptom combination",
  y = "Frequency in dataset")

```
  
More information on **ggupset** can be found [online](https://rdrr.io/cran/ggupset/man/scale_x_upset.html) or offline in the package documentation in your RStudio Help tab `?ggupset`.  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `UpSetR` {  }

The **UpSetR** package allows more customization of the plot, but it can be more difficult to execute:


**Load package**  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(UpSetR)
```

**Data cleaning**  

We must convert the `linelist` symptoms values to 1 / 0. 

```{r}
linelist_sym_2 <- linelist_sym %>% 
     # convert the "yes" and "no" values into 1s and 0s
     mutate(fever = ifelse(fever == "yes", 1, 0), 
            chills = ifelse(chills == "yes", 1, 0),
            cough = ifelse(cough == "yes", 1, 0),
            aches = ifelse(aches == "yes", 1, 0),
            vomit = ifelse(vomit == "yes", 1, 0))
            
```

If you are interested in a more efficient command, you can take advantage of the `+()` function, which converts to 1s and 0s based on a logical statement. This command utilizes the `across()` function to change multiple columns at once (read more in [Cleaning data and core functions](#clean_across)).  

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
# Efficiently convert "yes" to 1 and 0
linelist_sym_2 <- linelist_sym %>% 
  
  # convert the "yes" and "no" values into 1s and 0s
  mutate(across(c(fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit), .fns = ~+(.x == "yes")))
```


Now make the plot using the custom function `upset()` - using only the symptoms columns. You must designate which "sets" to compare (the names of the symptom columns). Alternatively, use `nsets = ` and `order.by = "freq"` to only show the top X combinations.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

# Make the plot
linelist_sym_2 %>% 
  UpSetR::upset(
       sets = c("fever", "chills", "cough", "aches", "vomit"),
       order.by = "freq",
       sets.bar.color = c("blue", "red", "yellow", "darkgreen", "orange"), # optional colors
       empty.intersections = "on",
       # nsets = 3,
       number.angles = 0,
       point.size = 3.5,
       line.size = 2, 
       mainbar.y.label = "Symptoms Combinations",
       sets.x.label = "Patients with Symptom")

```
