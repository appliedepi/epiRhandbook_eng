Demographic pyramids are useful to show distributions of age and gender. Similar code can be used to visualize the results of Likert-style survey questions (e.g. "Strongly agree", "Agree", "Neutral", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree"). In this page we cover the following:  

* Fast & easy pyramids using the **apyramid** package  
* More customizeable pyramids using `ggplot()`  
* Displaying "baseline" demographics in the background of the pyramid  
* Using pyramid-style plots to show other types of data (e.g responses to **Likert-style** survey questions)

## Preparation {}



### Load packages {.unnumbered}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(rio,       # to import data
               here,      # to locate files
               tidyverse, # to clean, handle, and plot the data (includes ggplot2 package)
               apyramid,  # a package dedicated to creating age pyramids
               janitor,   # tables and cleaning data
               stringr)   # working with strings for titles, captions, etc.
```




### Import data {.unnumbered}  

To begin, we import the cleaned linelist of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export] page for details).  

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import case linelist 
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

### Cleaning {.unnumbered}  

To make a traditional age/gender demographic pyramid, the data must first be cleaned in the following ways:  

* The gender column must be cleaned.  
* Depending on your method, age should be stored as either a numeric or in an *age category* column.  

If using age categories, the column values should be corrected ordered, either by default alpha-numeric or intentionally set by converting to class factor.  

Below we use `tabyl()` from **janitor** to inspect the columns `gender` and `age_cat5`.  

```{r}
linelist %>% 
  tabyl(age_cat5, gender)
```


We also run a quick histogram on the `age` column to ensure it is clean and correctly classified:  

```{r}
hist(linelist$age)
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## **apyramid** package {}

The package **apyramid** is a product of the [R4Epis](https://r4epis.netlify.com/) project. You can read more about this package [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apyramid/vignettes/intro.html). It allows you to quickly make an age pyramid. For more nuanced situations, see the section below [using `ggplot()`](#demo_pyr_gg). You can read more about the **apyramid** package in its Help page by entering `?age_pyramid` in your R console. 

### Linelist data {.unnumbered}  


Using the cleaned `linelist` dataset, we can create an age pyramid with one simple `age_pyramid()` command. In this command:  

* The `data = ` argument is set as the `linelist` data frame  
* The `age_group = ` argument (for y-axis) is set to the name of the categorical age column (in quotes)  
* The `split_by = ` argument (for x-axis) is set to the gender column  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender")
```


The pyramid can be displayed with percent of all cases on the x-axis, instead of counts, by including `proportional = TRUE`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      proportional = TRUE)
```


When using **agepyramid** package, if the `split_by` column is binary (e.g. male/female, or yes/no), then the result will appear as a pyramid. However if there are more than two values in the `split_by` column (not including `NA`), the pyramid will appears as a faceted bar plot with grey bars in the "background" indicating the range of the un-faceted data for that age group. In this case, values of `split_by = ` will appear as labels at top of each facet panel. For example, below is what occurs if the `split_by = ` is assigned the column `hospital`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "hospital")  
```

#### Missing values {.unnumbered}  

Rows that have `NA` missing values in the `split_by = ` or `age_group = ` columns, if coded as `NA`, will not trigger the faceting shown above. By default these rows will not be shown. However you can specify that they appear, in an adjacent barplot and as a separate age group at the top, by specifying `na.rm = FALSE`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      na.rm = FALSE)         # show patients missing age or gender
```

#### Proportions, colors, & aesthetics {.unnumbered}  

By default, the bars display counts (not %), a dashed mid-line for each group is shown, and the colors are green/purple. Each of these parameters can be adjusted, as shown below:  

You can also add additional `ggplot()` commands to the plot using the standard `ggplot()` "+" syntax, such as aesthetic themes and label adjustments: 

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(
  data = linelist,
  age_group = "age_cat5",
  split_by = "gender",
  proportional = TRUE,              # show percents, not counts
  show_midpoint = FALSE,            # remove bar mid-point line
  #pal = c("orange", "purple")      # can specify alt. colors here (but not labels)
  )+                 
  
  # additional ggplot commands
  theme_minimal()+                               # simplfy background
  scale_fill_manual(                             # specify colors AND labels
    values = c("orange", "purple"),              
    labels = c("m" = "Male", "f" = "Female"))+
  labs(y = "Percent of all cases",              # note x and y labs are switched
       x = "Age categories",                          
       fill = "Gender", 
       caption = "My data source and caption here",
       title = "Title of my plot",
       subtitle = "Subtitle with \n a second line...")+
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",                          # legend to bottom
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),  # fonts/sizes
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))
```



### Aggregated data {.unnumbered}  

The examples above assume your data are in a linelist format, with one row per observation. If your data are already aggregated into counts by age category, you can still use the **apyramid** package, as shown below.  

For demonstration, we aggregate the linelist data into counts by age category and gender, into a "wide" format. This will simulate as if your data were in counts to begin with. Learn more about [Grouping data] and [Pivoting data] in their respective pages.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
demo_agg <- linelist %>% 
  count(age_cat5, gender, name = "cases") %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = age_cat5,
    names_from = gender,
    values_from = cases) %>% 
  rename(`missing_gender` = `NA`)
```

...which makes the dataset looks like this: with columns for age category, and male counts, female counts, and missing counts.  

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# View the aggregated data
DT::datatable(demo_agg, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

To set-up these data for the age pyramid, we will pivot the data to be "long" with the `pivot_longer()` function from **dplyr**. This is because `ggplot()` generally prefers "long" data, and **apyramid** is using `ggplot()`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# pivot the aggregated data into long format
demo_agg_long <- demo_agg %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    col = c(f, m, missing_gender),            # cols to elongate
    names_to = "gender",                # name for new col of categories
    values_to = "counts") %>%           # name for new col of counts
  mutate(
    gender = na_if(gender, "missing_gender")) # convert "missing_gender" to NA
``` 

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# View the aggregated data
DT::datatable(demo_agg_long, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Then use the `split_by = ` and `count = ` arguments of `age_pyramid()` to specify the respective columns in the data:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = demo_agg_long,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",# column name for age category
                      split_by = "gender",   # column name for gender
                      count = "counts")      # column name for case counts
```

Note in the above, that the factor order of "m" and "f" is different (pyramid reversed). To adjust the order you must re-define gender in the aggregated data as a Factor and order the levels as desired. See the [Factors] page.  




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `ggplot()` {#demo_pyr_gg}


Using `ggplot()` to build your age pyramid allows for more flexibility, but requires more effort and understanding of how `ggplot()` works. It is also easier to accidentally make mistakes.  

To use `ggplot()` to make demographic pyramids, you create two bar plots (one for each gender), convert the values in one plot to negative, and finally flip the x and y axes to display the bar plots vertically, their bases meeting in the plot middle.  


### Preparation {.unnumbered}

This approach uses the *numeric* age column, not the *categorical* column of `age_cat5`. So we will check to ensure the class of this column is indeed numeric.  

```{r}
class(linelist$age)
```

You could use the same logic below to build a pyramid from categorical data using `geom_col()` instead of `geom_histogram()`.  

<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Constructing the plot {.unnumbered} 

First, understand that to make such a pyramid using `ggplot()` the approach is as follows:

* Within the `ggplot()`, create **two** histograms using the numeric age column. Create one for each of the two grouping values (in this case genders male and female). To do this, the data for each histogram are specified within their respective `geom_histogram()` commands, with the respective filters applied to `linelist`.    

* One graph will have positive count values, while the other will have its counts converted to negative values - this creates the "pyramid" with the `0` value in the middle of the plot. The negative values are created using a special **ggplot2** term `..count..` and multiplying by -1.  

* The command `coord_flip()` switches the X and Y axes, resulting in the graphs turning vertical and creating the pyramid.

* Lastly, the counts-axis value labels must be altered so they appear as "positive" counts on both sides of the pyramid (despite the underlying values on one side being negative). 

A **simple** version of this, using `geom_histogram()`, is below:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
  # begin ggplot
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  
  # female histogram
  geom_histogram(data = linelist %>% filter(gender == "f"),
                 breaks = seq(0,85,5),
                 colour = "white") +
  
  # male histogram (values converted to negative)
  geom_histogram(data = linelist %>% filter(gender == "m"),
                 breaks = seq(0,85,5),
                 mapping = aes(y = ..count..*(-1)),
                 colour = "white") +
  
  # flip the X and Y axes
  coord_flip() +
  
  # adjust counts-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-600, 900),
                     breaks = seq(-600,900,100),
                     labels = abs(seq(-600, 900, 100)))
```

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** If the **limits** of your counts axis are set too low, and a counts bar exceeds them, the bar will disappear entirely or be artificially shortened! Watch for this if analyzing data which is routinely updated. Prevent it by having your count-axis limits auto-adjust to your data, as below.</span>  

There are many things you can change/add to this simple version, including:  

* Auto adjust counts-axis scale to your data (avoid errors discussed in warning below)  
* Manually specify colors and legend labels  

**Convert counts to percents**  

To convert counts to percents (of total), do this in your data prior to plotting. Below, we get the age-gender counts, then `ungroup()`, and then `mutate()` to create new percent columns. If you want percents by gender, skip the ungroup step.  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create dataset with proportion of total
pyramid_data <- linelist %>%
  count(age_cat5,
        gender,
        name = "counts") %>% 
  ungroup() %>%                 # ungroup so percents are not by group
  mutate(percent = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)), digits = 1), 
         percent = case_when(
            gender == "f" ~ percent,
            gender == "m" ~ -percent,     # convert male to negative
            TRUE          ~ NA_real_))    # NA val must by numeric as well
```

Importantly, we save the max and min values so we know what the limits of the scale should be. These will be used in the `ggplot()` command below.    

```{r}
max_per <- max(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
min_per <- min(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)

max_per
min_per
```

Finally we make the `ggplot()` on the percent data. We specify `scale_y_continuous()` to extend the pre-defined lengths in each direction (positive and "negative"). We use `floor()` and `ceiling()` to round decimals the appropriate direction (down or up) for the side of the axis.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# begin ggplot
  ggplot()+  # default x-axis is age in years;

  # case data graph
  geom_col(data = pyramid_data,
           mapping = aes(
             x = age_cat5,
             y = percent,
             fill = gender),         
           colour = "white")+       # white around each bar
  
  # flip the X and Y axes to make pyramid vertical
  coord_flip()+
  

  # adjust the axes scales
  # scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100,5), labels = seq(0,100,5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(min_per, max_per),
    breaks = seq(from = floor(min_per),                # sequence of values, by 2s
                 to = ceiling(max_per),
                 by = 2),
    labels = paste0(abs(seq(from = floor(min_per),     # sequence of absolute values, by 2s, with "%"
                            to = ceiling(max_per),
                            by = 2)),
                    "%"))+  

  # designate colors and legend labels manually
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("f" = "orange",
               "m" = "darkgreen"),
    labels = c("Female", "Male")) +
  
  # label values (remember X and Y flipped now)
  labs(
    title = "Age and gender of cases",
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Percent of total",
    fill = NULL,
    caption = stringr::str_glue("Data are from linelist \nn = {nrow(linelist)} (age or sex missing for {sum(is.na(linelist$gender) | is.na(linelist$age_years))} cases) \nData as of: {format(Sys.Date(), '%d %b %Y')}")) +
  
  # display themes
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, size=11, face = "italic")
    )

```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Compare to baseline  {.unnumbered} 

With the flexibility of `ggplot()`, you can have a second layer of bars in the background that represent the "true" or "baseline" population pyramid. This can provide a nice visualization to compare the observed with the baseline.  

Import and view the population data (see [Download handbook and data] page):

```{r echo=F}
# import the population demographics data
pop <- rio::import(here::here("data", "standardization", "country_demographics.csv"))
```

```{r eval=F}
# import the population demographics data
pop <- rio::import("country_demographics.csv")
```

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(pop, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


First some data management steps:  

Here we record the order of age categories that we want to appear. Due to some quirks the way the `ggplot()` is implemented, in this specific scenario it is easiest to store these as a character vector and use them later in the plotting function.  

```{r}
# record correct age cat levels
age_levels <- c("0-4","5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24",
                "25-29","30-34", "35-39", "40-44", "45-49",
                "50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74",
                "75-79", "80-84", "85+")
```

Combine the population and case data through the **dplyr** function `bind_rows()`:  

* First, ensure they have the *exact same* column names, age categories values, and gender values  
* Make them have the same data structure: columns of age category, gender, counts, and percent of total  
* Bind them together, one on-top of the other (`bind_rows()`)  



```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create/transform populaton data, with percent of total
########################################################
pop_data <- pop %>% 
  pivot_longer(      # pivot gender columns longer
    cols = c(m, f),
    names_to = "gender",
    values_to = "counts") %>% 
  
  mutate(
    percent  = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)),1),  # % of total
    percent  = case_when(                                                        
     gender == "f" ~ percent,
     gender == "m" ~ -percent,               # if male, convert % to negative
     TRUE          ~ NA_real_))
```

Review the changed population dataset

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(pop_data, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Now implement the same for the case linelist.  Slightly different because it begins with case-rows, not counts.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create case data by age/gender, with percent of total
#######################################################
case_data <- linelist %>%
  count(age_cat5, gender, name = "counts") %>%  # counts by age-gender groups
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    percent = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)),1),  # calculate % of total for age-gender groups
    percent = case_when(                                     # convert % to negative if male
      gender == "f" ~ percent,
      gender == "m" ~ -percent,
      TRUE          ~ NA_real_))
```

Review the changed case dataset  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(case_data, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Now the two data frames are combined, one on top of the other (they have the same column names). We can "name" each of the data frame, and use the `.id = ` argument to create a new column "data_source" that will indicate which data frame each row originated from. We can use this column to filter in the `ggplot()`.  



```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# combine case and population data (same column names, age_cat values, and gender values)
pyramid_data <- bind_rows("cases" = case_data, "population" = pop_data, .id = "data_source")
```

Store the maximum and minimum percent values, used in the plotting function to define the extent of the plot (and not cut short any bars!)  

```{r}
# Define extent of percent axis, used for plot limits
max_per <- max(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
min_per <- min(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
```

Now the plot is made with `ggplot()`: 

* One bar graph of population data (wider, more transparent bars)
* One bar graph of case data (small, more solid bars)

## Likert scale {}

The techniques used to make a population pyramid with `ggplot()` can also be used to make plots of Likert-scale survey data.  

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
data_raw <- import("P:/Shared/equateur_mve_2020/lessons learned/Ebola After-Action Survey - HQ epi team (form responses).csv")


likert_data <- data_raw %>% 
  select(2, 4:11) %>% 
  rename(status = 1,
         Q1 = 2,
         Q2 = 3,
            Q3 = 4,
            Q4 = 5,
            Q5 = 6,
            Q6 = 7,
            Q7 = 8,
            Q8 = 9) %>% 
  mutate(status = case_when(
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Mar") ~ "Senior",
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Jan") ~ "Intermediate",
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Feb") ~ "Junior",
           TRUE ~ "Senior")) %>% 
  mutate(Q4 = recode(Q4, "Not applicable" = "Very Poor"))

table(likert_data$status)

rio::export(likert_data, here::here("data", "likert_data.csv"))
```

Import the data (see [Download handbook and data] page if desired).  

```{r echo=F}
# import the likert survey response data
likert_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "likert_data.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the likert survey response data
likert_data <- rio::import("likert_data.csv")
```

Start with data that looks like this, with a categorical classification of each respondent (`status`) and their answers to 8 questions on a 4-point Likert-type scale ("Very poor", "Poor", "Good", "Very good").  

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(likert_data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

First, some data management steps:  

* Pivot the data longer  
* Create new column `direction` depending on whether response was generally "positive" or "negative"  
* Set the Factor level order for the `status` column and the `Response` column  
* Store the max count value so limits of plot are appropriate  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
melted <- likert_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = Q1:Q8,
    names_to = "Question",
    values_to = "Response") %>% 
  mutate(
    
    direction = case_when(
      Response %in% c("Poor","Very Poor")  ~ "Negative",
      Response %in% c("Good", "Very Good") ~ "Positive",
      TRUE                                 ~ "Unknown"),
    
    status = fct_relevel(status, "Junior", "Intermediate", "Senior"),
    
    # must reverse 'Very Poor' and 'Poor' for ordering to work
    Response = fct_relevel(Response, "Very Good", "Good", "Very Poor", "Poor")) 

# get largest value for scale limits
melted_max <- melted %>% 
  count(status, Question) %>% # get counts
  pull(n) %>%                 # column 'n'
  max(na.rm=T)                # get max
```


Now make the plot. As in the age pyramids above, we are creating two bar plots and inverting the values of one of them to negative. 

We use `geom_bar()` because our data are one row per observation, not aggregated counts. We use the special **ggplot2** term `..count..` in one of the bar plots to invert the values negative (*-1), and we set `position = "stack"` so the values stack on top of each other.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# make plot
ggplot()+
     
  # bar graph of the "negative" responses 
     geom_bar(
       data = melted %>% filter(direction == "Negative"),
       mapping = aes(
         x = status,
         y = ..count..*(-1),    # counts inverted to negative
         fill = Response),
       color = "black",
       closed = "left",
       position = "stack")+
     
     # bar graph of the "positive responses
     geom_bar(
       data = melted %>% filter(direction == "Positive"),
       mapping = aes(
         x = status,
         fill = Response),
       colour = "black",
       closed = "left",
       position = "stack")+
     
     # flip the X and Y axes
     coord_flip()+
  
     # Black vertical line at 0
     geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "black", size=1)+
     
    # convert labels to all positive numbers
    scale_y_continuous(
      
      # limits of the x-axis scale
      limits = c(-ceiling(melted_max/10)*11,    # seq from neg to pos by 10, edges rounded outward to nearest 5
                 ceiling(melted_max/10)*10),   
      
      # values of the x-axis scale
      breaks = seq(from = -ceiling(melted_max/10)*10,
                   to = ceiling(melted_max/10)*10,
                   by = 10),
      
      # labels of the x-axis scale
      labels = abs(unique(c(seq(-ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, 0, 10),
                            seq(0, ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, 10))))) +
     
    # color scales manually assigned 
    scale_fill_manual(
      values = c("Very Good"  = "green4", # assigns colors
                "Good"      = "green3",
                "Poor"      = "yellow",
                "Very Poor" = "red3"),
      breaks = c("Very Good", "Good", "Poor", "Very Poor"))+ # orders the legend
     
    
     
    # facet the entire plot so each question is a sub-plot
    facet_wrap( ~ Question, ncol = 3)+
     
    # labels, titles, caption
    labs(
      title = str_glue("Likert-style responses\nn = {nrow(likert_data)}"),
      x = "Respondent status",
      y = "Number of responses",
      fill = "")+

     # display adjustments 
     theme_minimal()+
     theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
           axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
           strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),  # facet sub-titles
           plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "black")) # black box around each facet
```
