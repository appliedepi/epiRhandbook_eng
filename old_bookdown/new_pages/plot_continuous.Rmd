This page will discuss appropriate plotting of continuous data, such as age, clinical measurements, and distance. We focus on use of **ggplot2** (part of the **tidyverse** family of packages), but also brielfly describe **base** R plotting functions.  

Visualisations covered here include:

* Plots for one continuous variable:  
  * **Histogram**, a classic graph to present the distribution of a continuous variable. 
  * **Box plot** (also called box and whisker), to show the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, tail ends of the distribution, and outliers ([important limitations](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html)).  
  * **Jitter plot**, to show all values as points that are 'jittered' so they can (mostly) all be seen, even where two have the same value.  
  * **Violin plot**, show the distribution of a continuous variable based on the symmetrical width of the 'violin'. 
  * **Sina plot**, are a combination of jitter and violin plots, where individual points are shown but in the symmetrical shape of the distribution (via **ggforce** package).  
* **Scatter plot** for two continuous variables.  
* **Heat plots** for three continuous variables (linked to [Heat plots] page)  







<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }

Preparation includes loading the relevant packages, here **ggplot2** and **dplyr** (both part of **tidyverse**), and ensuring your data columns are of the correct class. 

### Load packages {.unnumbered}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

Note: The mega-package **tidyverse** includes the pacakage **ggplot2** and **dplyr** among many others (e.g. **stringr**, **tidyr**, and **forcats**).  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # data import and export
  here,           # relative file paths
  tidyverse       # includes ggplot2 and dplyr
  )
```



### Import data {.unnumbered}

For the examples in this page, we import the cleaned linelist of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export] page for details).  

```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below. We will focus on the continuous variables `age`, `wt_kg` (weight in kilos), `ct_blood` (CT, cycle-threshold values), and `days_onset_hosp` (difference between date of symptom onset and date of hospitalisation).  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```





### Column class {.unnumbered}  

Ensure that the continuous columns are correcly classified in R as class numeric. Below we use `mutate()` and `as.numeric()`to ensure the class of the columns that are important to our analysis. See the page on [Cleaning data and core functions] for more detail.  

```{r}
linelist <- linelist %>%  
  mutate(
    across(                                             # mutate multiple columns at once
      .cols = c(age, ct_blood, days_onset_hosp, wt_kg), # columns to transform
      .fns = as.numeric                                 # function to use (without parentheses)
      )
    )                               
 
```

Note: You should have conducted various data checks before this point, including checking the missingness of the data. See the page [Missing data] for tips on these analyses.  





## One continuous variable  



### Histograms {.unnumbered}

Below is code for generating **histograms**, which group continuous data into ranges and display in adjacent bars of varying height. This is done using `geom_histogram()`. See the ["Bar plot" section](#ggplot_basics_bars) of the ggplot basics page to understand difference between `geom_histogram()`, `geom_bar()`, and `geom_col()`.  

We will show the distribution of ages of cases. Within `mapping = aes()` specify which column you want to see the distribution of. You can assign this column to either the x or the y axis. 

The rows will be assigned to "bins" based on their numeric age, and these bins will be graphically represented by bars. If you specify a number of bins with the `bins = ` plot aesthetic, the break points are evenly spaced between the minimum and maximum values of the histogram. If `bins = ` is unspecified, an appropriate number of bins will be guessed and this message displayed after the plot:  

```
## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.
``` 

If you do not want to specify a number of bins to `bins = `, you could alternatively specify `binwidth = ` in the units of the axis. We give a few examples showing different bins and bin widths:  

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# A) Regular histogram
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = "A) Default histogram (30 bins)")

# B) More bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)+
  labs(title = "B) Set to 50 bins")

# C) Fewer bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)+
  labs(title = "C) Set to 5 bins")


# D) More bins
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+  # provide x variable
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+
  labs(title = "D) binwidth of 1")

# E) Layered histograms with different bin widths
ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age))+         # provide x variable 
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 2) +                    # Underlying layer has binwidth of 2
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 1,                      # Top layer has binwidth of 1
    alpha = 0.4,                       # Set top layer to be slightly see through
    fill = "blue")+ 
  labs(title = "E) Layered histograms with different binwidths")

```



To get smoothed proportions, you can use `geom_density()`:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# Frequency with proportion axis, smoothed
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age), fill = gender) +
  geom_density(binwidth = 2, size = 2, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Proportional, smoothed with geom_density()")
```


To get a "stacked" histogram (of a continuous column of data), you can do one of the following:  

1) Use `geom_histogram()` with the `fill = ` argument within `aes()` and assigned to the grouping column, or  
2) Use `geom_freqpoly()`, which is likely easier to read (you can still set `binwidth = `)  
3) To see proportions of all values, set the `y = after_stat(density)` (use this syntax exactly - not changed for your data). Note: these proportions will show *per group*.  

Each is shown below (*note use of `color = ` vs. `fill = ` in each):  

```{r, fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# "Stacked" histogram
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)+
  labs(title = "'Stacked' histogram")

# Frequency 
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 2, size = 2)+
  labs(title = "Freqpoly")

# Frequency with proportion axis
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = after_stat(density), color = gender)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 5, size = 2)+
  labs(title = "Proportional freqpoly")

# Frequency with proportion axis, smoothed
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = after_stat(density), fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(binwidth = 2, size = 2, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Proportional, smoothed with geom_density()")
```

If you want to have some fun, try `geom_density_ridges` from the **ggridges** package ([vignette here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html).  

Read more in detail about histograms at the **tidyverse** [page on geom_histogram()](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html).  



### Box plots {.unnumbered}

Box plots are common, but have important limitations. They can obscure the actual distribution - e.g. a bi-modal distribution. See this [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/boxplot.html) and this [data-to-viz article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html) for more details. However, they do nicely display the inter-quartile range and outliers - so they can be overlaid on top of other types of plots that show the distribution in more detail.  

Below is the box plot anatomy ([image source](https://www.leansigmacorporation.com/box-plot-with-minitab/)).  

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "boxplot.png"))
```


When using `geom_boxplot()` to create a box plot, you generally map only one axis (x or y) within `aes()`. The axis specified determines if the plots are horizontal or vertical. 

In most geoms, you create a plot per group by mapping an aesthetic like `color = ` or `fill = ` to a column within `aes()`. However, for box plots achieve this by assigning the grouping column to the un-assigned axis (x or y). Below is code for a boxplot of *all* age values in the dataset, and second is code to display one box plot for each (non-missing) gender in the dataset. Note that `NA` (missing) values will appear as a separate box plot unless removed. In this example we also set the `fill` to the column `outcome` so each plot is a different color - but this is not necessary.  

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# A) Overall boxplot
ggplot(data = linelist)+  
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y = age))+   # only y axis mapped (not x)
  labs(title = "A) Overall boxplot")

# B) Box plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(y = age, x = gender, fill = gender)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+                     
  theme(legend.position = "none")+   # remove legend (redundant)
  labs(title = "B) Boxplot by gender")      
```

For code to add a box plot to the edges of a scatter plot ("marginal" plots) see the page [ggplot tips].  





### Violin, jitter, and sina plots {.unnumbered}

Below is code for creating **violin plots** (`geom_violin`) and **jitter plots** (`geom_jitter`) to show distributions. You can specify that the fill or color is also determined by the data, by inserting these options within `aes()`. 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}


# A) Jitter plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% drop_na(outcome),      # remove missing values
       mapping = aes(y = age,                     # Continuous variable
           x = outcome,                           # Grouping variable
           color = outcome))+                     # Color variable
  geom_jitter()+                                  # Create the violin plot
  labs(title = "A) jitter plot by gender")     



# B) Violin plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% drop_na(outcome),       # remove missing values
       mapping = aes(y = age,                      # Continuous variable
           x = outcome,                            # Grouping variable
           fill = outcome))+                       # fill variable (color)
  geom_violin()+                                   # create the violin plot
  labs(title = "B) violin plot by gender")    


```

One can combine the two using the `geom_sina()` function from the **ggforce** package. The sina plot the jitter points in the shape of the violin plot. When overlaid on the violin plot (adjusting the transparencies) this can be easier to visually interpret.  

Plot A) on the left shows basic layering of both a `geom_violin()` and `geom_sina()`. Plot B shows slightly more effort put into the appearance of the ggplot (see in-line comments).  

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

pacman::p_load(ggforce)

# A) Sina plot by group
ggplot(data = linelist %>% drop_na(outcome), 
       aes(y = age,             # numeric variable
           x = outcome)) +      # group variable
  geom_violin()+                # create the violin plot base
  geom_sina()+                  # add jitter points in shape of violin
  labs(title = "A) violin and sina plot by gender")      


# A) Sina plot by group
ggplot(
  data = linelist %>% drop_na(outcome), 
  aes(y = age,           # numeric variable
      x = outcome)) +    # group variable
  geom_violin(
    aes(fill = outcome), # fill (color of violin background)
    color = "white",     # white outline
    alpha = 0.2)+        # transparency
  geom_sina(
    size=1,                # Change the size of the jitter
    aes(color = outcome))+ # color (color of dots)
  scale_fill_manual(       # Define fill for violin background by death/recover
    values = c("Death" = "#bf5300", 
              "Recover" = "#11118c")) + 
  scale_color_manual(      # Define colours for points by death/recover
    values = c("Death" = "#bf5300", 
              "Recover" = "#11118c")) + 
  theme_minimal() +                                # Remove the gray background
  theme(legend.position = "none") +                # Remove unnecessary legend
  labs(title = "B) violin and sina plot by gender, with extra formatting")      



```



<!-- ### One continuous variable within facets {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- **Faceting basics**  -->

<!-- To examine further subgroups, one can 'facet' the graph. This means the plot will be recreated within specified subgroups. One can use: -->

<!-- * `facet_wrap()` - this will recreate the sub-graphs and present them alphabetically (typically, unless stated otherwise). You can invoke certain options to determine the look of the facets, e.g. `nrow=1` or `ncol=1` to control the number of rows or columns that the faceted plots are arranged within. See plot A below.  -->
<!-- * `facet_grid()` - this is suited to seeing subgroups for particular combinations of discrete variables. See plot B  below. `nrow` and `ncol` are not relevant, as the subgroups are presented in a grid, with the subgroups always in the x or y axis (see notes in code below) -->

<!-- You can stipulate up to two faceting variables, with a '~' between them. If only one faceting variable, a '.' is used as a placeholder for a non-used second faceting variable - see code examples. -->

<!-- ```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')} -->
<!-- # A) Histogram of hospitalisation dates faceted by hospital -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>%  -->
<!--          filter(hospital != "Missing"),               # filter removes unknown hospital -->
<!--        aes(x = date_hospitalisation ))+ -->
<!--   geom_histogram(binwidth=7) +                        # Bindwidth = 7 days -->
<!--   labs(title = "A) 2 histogram of hospitalisation dates by hospital")+ -->
<!--   facet_wrap(hospital~.,                              # Facet by just hospital -->
<!--             ncol = 2)                                 # Facet in two columns -->

<!-- # B) Boxplot of age faceted in a grid with two variables, gender and outcome -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>%  -->
<!--          filter(!is.na(gender) & !is.na(outcome)),    # filter retains non-missing gender/outcome -->
<!--        aes(y = age))+ -->
<!--   geom_boxplot()+ -->
<!--   labs(title = "A) A boxplot by gender and outcome")+ -->
<!--   facet_grid(outcome~gender)                          # Outcome is the row, gender is the column -->

<!-- ``` -->


## Two continuous variables  

Following similar syntax, `geom_point()` will allow you to plot two continuous variables against each other in a **scatter plot**. This is useful for showing actual values rather than their distributions.

A basic scatter plot of age vs weight is shown in (A). In (B) we again use `facet_grid()` to show the relationship between two continuous variables in the linelist. 

```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')}
# Basic scatter plot of weight and age
ggplot(data = linelist, 
       mapping = aes(y = wt_kg, x = age))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "A) Scatter plot of weight and age")

# Scatter plot of weight and age by gender and Ebola outcome
ggplot(data = linelist %>% drop_na(gender, outcome), # filter retains non-missing gender/outcome
       mapping = aes(y = wt_kg, x = age))+
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "B) Scatter plot of weight and age faceted by gender and outcome")+
  facet_grid(gender ~ outcome) 

```


### Three continuous variables {.unnumbered}  

You can display three continuous variables by utilizing the `fill = ` argument to create a *heat plot*. The color of each "cell" will reflect the value of the third continuous column of data. See the page on [Heat plots] for more details and several examples. 

There are ways to make 3D plots in R, but for applied epidemiology these are often difficult to interpret and therefore less useful for decision-making.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Plotting with base graphics {  }

We present methods to plot using **base** R graphics in case the user is not yet familiar with **ggplot2** or does not have it installed. The syntax can be more simple, but arguably the plots do not look as nice and are harder to customize.  

### One continuous variable {.unnumbered}

#### Box plots and histograms {.unnumbered}

The in-built **base** R graphics package comes with the `boxplot()` and `hist()` functions, allowing straight-forward visualisation of a continuous variable. These commands can be typed quicky and so are useful for a "quick look". Remember that you need to write *each* data frame and column in the "dollar sign" syntax - `dataframe$column`. The `main = ` argument is used to create a title.  

```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

# Boxplot
boxplot(linelist$wt_kg, main = "A) Base boxplot") 


# Histogram
hist(linelist$wt_kg, main = "B) Base histogram") 

```

#### Subgroups {.unnumbered}  

Subgroups can be created with formula syntax. Note in plot B below,  ```outcome``` and ```gender``` are written as ```outcome*gender``` such that the boxplots exist for the four combinations of these two columns. They do not get faceted across different rows and columns like in **ggplot2**. We specify `linelist` to `data = ` so we do not need to use the `$` syntax all the time.  

```{r, fig.show='hold', out.width=c('50%', '50%')}

# Box plot by subgroup
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
                  data = linelist, 
                  main = "A) Base boxplot by subgroup")

# Box plot by crossed subgroups
boxplot(age ~ outcome*gender,
                  data = linelist, 
                  main = "B) Base boxplot) by crossed groups")

```

Some further options with `boxplot()` shown below are:  

* Boxplot width proportional to sample size (A)
* Violin plots, with notched representing the median and x around it (B)
* Horizontal (C)  


```{r, out.width=c('33%', '33%', '33%'), fig.show='hold'}

# Varying width by sample size 
boxplot(linelist$age ~ linelist$outcome,
                  varwidth = TRUE, # width varying by sample size
                  main="A) Proportional boxplot() widths")

                  
# Notched (violin plot), and varying width
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
        data=linelist,
        notch=TRUE,      # notch at median
        main="B) Notched boxplot()",
        col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
        xlab="Suppliment and Dose")

# Horizontal
boxplot(age ~ outcome,
        data=linelist,
        horizontal=TRUE,  # flip to horizontal
        col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
        main="C) Horizontal boxplot()",
        xlab="Suppliment and Dose")
```

### Two continuous variables {.unnumbered}

Using base R, we can quickly visualise the relationship between two continuous variables with the `plot` function.


```{r}
plot(linelist$age, linelist$wt_kg)
```
