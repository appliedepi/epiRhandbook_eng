This page demonstrates how to convert summary data frames into presentation-ready tables with the **flextable** package. These tables can be inserted into powerpoint slides, HTML pages, PDF or Word documents, etc.  

Understand that *before* using **flextable**, you must create the summary table as a data frame. Use methods from the [Descriptive tables] and [Pivoting data] pages such as tabulations, cross-tabulations, pivoting, and calculating descriptive statistics. The resulting data frame can then be passed to **flextable** for display formatting.  


There are many other R packages that can be used to craft tables for presentation - we chose to highlight **flextable** in this page. An example using the **knitr** package and its `kable()` function can be found in the [Contact Tracing] page. Likewise, the **DT** package is highlighted in the page [Dashboards with Shiny]. Others such as **GT** and **huxtable** are mentione in the [Suggested packages] page.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {  }

### Load packages {.unnumbered} 

Install and load **flextable**. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file pathways
  flextable,      # make HTML tables 
  officer,        # helper functions for tables
  tidyverse)      # data management, summary, and visualization

```

### Import data {.unnumbered}  

To begin, we import the cleaned linelist of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/epirhandbook/Epi_R_handbook/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export] page for details). 


```{r, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

### Prepare table {.unnumbered}  

*Before* beginning to use **flextable** you will need to *create* your table as a data frame. See the page on [Descriptive tables] and [Pivoting data] to learn how to create a data frame using packages such as **janitor** and **dplyr**. You must arrange the content in rows and columns as you want it displayed. Then, the data frame will be passed to **flextable** to display it with colors, headers, fonts, etc. 
  
Below is an example from the [Descriptive tables] page of converting the case `linelist` into a data frame that summarises patient outcomes and CT values by hospital, with a Totals row at the bottom. The output is saved as `table`.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table <- linelist %>% 
  
  # Get summary values per hospital-outcome group
  ###############################################
  group_by(hospital, outcome) %>%                      # Group data
  summarise(                                           # Create new summary columns of indicators of interest
    N = n(),                                            # Number of rows per hospital-outcome group     
    ct_value = median(ct_blood, na.rm=T)) %>%           # median CT value per group
  
  # add totals
  ############
  bind_rows(                                           # Bind the previous table with this mini-table of totals
    linelist %>% 
      filter(!is.na(outcome) & hospital != "Missing") %>%
      group_by(outcome) %>%                            # Grouped only by outcome, not by hospital    
      summarise(
        N = n(),                                       # Number of rows for whole dataset     
        ct_value = median(ct_blood, na.rm=T))) %>%     # Median CT for whole dataset
  
  # Pivot wider and format
  ########################
  mutate(hospital = replace_na(hospital, "Total")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(                                         # Pivot from long to wide
    values_from = c(ct_value, N),                       # new values are from ct and count columns
    names_from = outcome) %>%                           # new column names are from outcomes
  mutate(                                              # Add new columns
    N_Known = N_Death + N_Recover,                               # number with known outcome
    Pct_Death = scales::percent(N_Death / N_Known, 0.1),         # percent cases who died (to 1 decimal)
    Pct_Recover = scales::percent(N_Recover / N_Known, 0.1)) %>% # percent who recovered (to 1 decimal)
  select(                                              # Re-order columns
    hospital, N_Known,                                   # Intro columns
    N_Recover, Pct_Recover, ct_value_Recover,            # Recovered columns
    N_Death, Pct_Death, ct_value_Death)  %>%             # Death columns
  arrange(N_Known)                                    # Arrange rows from lowest to highest (Total row at bottom)

table  # print

```




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Basic flextable {  }

### Create a flextable {.unnumbered}  

To create and manage **flextable** objects, we first pass the data frame through the `flextable()` function. We save the result as `my_table`.  

```{r}

my_table <- flextable(table) 
my_table

```

After doing this, we can progressively pipe the `my_table` object through more **flextable** formatting functions.  

In this page for sake of clarity we will save the table at intermediate steps as `my_table`, adding **flextable** functions bit-by-bit. If you want to see *all* the code from beginning to end written in one chunk, visit the [All code together](#tbl_pres_all) section below.  

The general syntax of each line of **flextable** code is as follows:

* `function(table, i = X, j = X, part = "X")`, where:
  * The 'function' can be one of many different functions, such as `width()` to determine column widths, `bg()` to set background colours, `align()` to set whether text is centre/right/left aligned, and so on. 
  * `table = ` is the name of the data frame, although does not need to be stated if the data frame is piped into the function.
  * `part = ` refers to which part of the table the function is being applied to. E.g. "header", "body" or "all". 
  * `i = ` specifies the *row* to apply the function to, where 'X' is the row number. If multiple rows, e.g. the first to third rows, one can specify: `i = c(1:3)`. Note if 'body' is selected, the first row starts from underneath the header section.
  * `j = ` specifies the *column* to apply the function to, where 'x' is the column number or name. If multiple columns, e.g. the fifth and sixth, one can specify: `j = c(5,6)`. 
  
You can find the complete list of **flextable** formatting function [here](https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/reference/index.html) or review the documentation by entering `?flextable`.  


### Column width {.unnumbered}

We can use the `autofit()` function, which nicely stretches out the table so that each cell only has one row of text. The function `qflextable()` is a convenient shorthand for `flextable()` and `autofit()`.  

```{r}

my_table %>% autofit()

```

However, this might not always be appropriate, especially if there are very long values within cells, meaning the table might not fit on the page. 

Instead, we can specify widths with the `width()` function. It can take some playing around to know what width value to put. In the example below, we specify different widths for column 1, column 2, and columns 4 to 8. 

```{r}

my_table <- my_table %>% 
  width(j=1, width = 2.7) %>% 
  width(j=2, width = 1.5) %>% 
  width(j=c(4,5,7,8), width = 1)

my_table
  
```

### Column headers {.unnumbered}

We want more clearer headers for easier interpretation of the table contents.

For this table, we will want to add a second header layer so that columns covering the same subgroups can be grouped together. We do this with the `add_header_row()` function with `top = TRUE`. We provide the new name of each column to `values = `, leaving empty values `""` for columns we know we will merge together later.  

We also rename the header names in the now-second header in a separate `set_header_labels()` command.  

Finally, to "combine" certain column headers in the top header we use `merge_at()` to merge the column headers in the top header row.  

```{r}
my_table <- my_table %>% 
  
  add_header_row(
    top = TRUE,                # New header goes on top of existing header row
    values = c("Hospital",     # Header values for each column below
               "Total cases with known outcome", 
               "Recovered",    # This will be the top-level header for this and two next columns
               "",
               "",
               "Died",         # This will be the top-level header for this and two next columns
               "",             # Leave blank, as it will be merged with "Died"
               "")) %>% 
    
  set_header_labels(         # Rename the columns in original header row
      hospital = "", 
      N_Known = "",                  
      N_Recover = "Total",
      Pct_Recover = "% of cases",
      ct_value_Recover = "Median CT values",
      N_Death = "Total",
      Pct_Death = "% of cases",
      ct_value_Death = "Median CT values")  %>% 
  
  merge_at(i = 1, j = 3:5, part = "header") %>% # Horizontally merge columns 3 to 5 in new header row
  merge_at(i = 1, j = 6:8, part = "header")     # Horizontally merge columns 6 to 8 in new header row

my_table  # print

```

### Borders and background {.unnumbered}  

You can adjust the borders, internal lines, etc. with various **flextable** functions. It is often easier to start by removing all existing borders with `border_remove()`.  

Then, you can apply default border themes by passing the table to `theme_box()`, `theme_booktabs()`, or `theme_alafoli()`.  

You can add vertical and horizontal lines with a variety of functions. `hline()` and `vline()` add lines to a specified row or column, respectively. Within each, you must specify the `part = ` as either "all", "body", or "header". For vertical lines, specify the column to `j = `, and for horizontal lines the row to `i = `. Other functions like `vline_right()`, `vline_left()`, `hline_top()`, and `hline_bottom()` add lines to the outsides only.  

In all of these functions, the actual line style itself must be specified to `border = ` and must be the output of a separate command using the `fp_border()` function from the **officer** package. This function helps you define the width and color of the line. You can define this above the table commands, as shown below.  

```{r}
# define style for border line
border_style = officer::fp_border(color="black", width=1)

# add border lines to table
my_table <- my_table %>% 

  # Remove all existing borders
  border_remove() %>%  
  
  # add horizontal lines via a pre-determined theme setting
  theme_booktabs() %>% 
  
  # add vertical lines to separate Recovered and Died sections
  vline(part = "all", j = 2, border = border_style) %>%   # at column 2 
  vline(part = "all", j = 5, border = border_style)       # at column 5

my_table
```

### Font and alignment {.unnumbered}

We centre-align all columns aside from the left-most column with the hospital names, using the `align()` function from **flextable**.

```{r}
my_table <- my_table %>% 
   flextable::align(align = "center", j = c(2:8), part = "all") 
my_table
```

Additionally, we can increase the header font size and change then to bold. We can also change the total row to bold.  

```{r}

my_table <-  my_table %>%  
  fontsize(i = 1, size = 12, part = "header") %>%   # adjust font size of header
  bold(i = 1, bold = TRUE, part = "header") %>%     # adjust bold face of header
  bold(i = 7, bold = TRUE, part = "body")           # adjust bold face of total row (row 7 of body)

my_table

```


We can ensure that the proportion columns display only one decimal place using the function `colformat_num()`. Note this could also have been done at data management stage with the `round()` function. 

```{r}
my_table <- colformat_num(my_table, j = c(4,7), digits = 1)
my_table
```

### Merge cells {.unnumbered}  

Just as we merge cells horizontally in the header row, we can also merge cells vertically using `merge_at()` and specifying the rows (`i`) and column (`j`). Here we merge the "Hospital" and "Total cases with known outcome" values vertically to give them more space.   

```{r}
my_table <- my_table %>% 
  merge_at(i = 1:2, j = 1, part = "header") %>% 
  merge_at(i = 1:2, j = 2, part = "header")

my_table
```

### Background color {.unnumbered}

To distinguish the content of the table from the headers, we may want to add additional formatting. e.g. changing the background color. In this example we change the table body to gray.

```{r}
my_table <- my_table %>% 
    bg(part = "body", bg = "gray95")  

my_table 
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Conditional formatting {  }

We can highlight all values in a column that meet a certain rule, e.g. where more than 55% of cases died. Simply put the criteria to the `i = ` or `j = ` argument, preceded by a tilde `~`. Reference the column in the data frame, not the display heading values.  

```{r}

my_table %>% 
  bg(j = 7, i = ~ Pct_Death >= 55, part = "body", bg = "red") 

```



Or, we can highlight the entire row meeting a certain criterion, such as a hospital of interest. To do this we just remove the column (`j`) specification so the criteria apply to all columns.


```{r}

my_table %>% 
  bg(., i= ~ hospital == "Military Hospital", part = "body", bg = "#91c293") 

```

## Saving your table {  }

There are different ways the table can be integrated into your output. 

### Save single table {.unnumbered}

You can export the tables to Word, PowerPoint or HTML or as an image (PNG) files. To do this, use one of the following functions:

* `save_as_docx()`  
* `save_as_pptx()`  
* `save_as_image()`  
* `save_as_html()`  

For instance below we save our table as a word document. Note the syntax of the first argument - you can just provide the name of your flextable object e.g. `my_table`, or you can give is a "name" as shown below (the name is "my table"). If name, this will appear as the title of the table in Word. We also demonstrate code to save as PNG image.  

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=F}
# Edit the 'my table' as needed for the title of table.  
save_as_docx("my table" = my_table, path = "file.docx")

save_as_image(my_table, path = "file.png")
```

Note the packages `webshot` or `webshot2` are required to save a flextable as an image. Images may come out with transparent backgrounds.

If you want to view a 'live' version of the **flextable** output in the intended document format, use `print()` and specify one of the below to `preview = `. The document will "pop-up" open on your computer in the specified software program, but will not be saved. This can be useful to check if the table fits in one page/slide or so you can quickly copy it into another document, you can use the print method with the argument preview set to “pptx” or “docx”.  

```{r, eval=F}
print(my_table, preview = "docx") # Word document example
print(my_table, preview = "pptx") # Powerpoint example
```

### Print table in R markdown {.unnumbered}  

This table can be integrated into your an automated document, an R markdown output, if the table object is called within the R markdown chunk. This means the table can be updated as part of a report where the data might change, so the numbers can be refreshed.

See detail in the [Reports with R Markdown] page of this handbook.
