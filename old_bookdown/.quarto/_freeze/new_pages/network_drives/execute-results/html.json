This page contains approaches, common errors, and suggestions on troubleshooting gained from our experience working through these issues. These include tips for the particularly delicate situations involving R Markdown.  \n\n\n**Using R on Network Drives: Overarching principles**  \n\n1) You must get administrator access for your computer. Setup RStudio specifically to run as administrator.  \n2) Save packages to a library on a lettered drive (e.g. \"C:\") when possible. Use a package library whose path begins with \"\\\\\\\" as little as possible.  \n3) the **rmarkdown** package must **not** be in a \"\\\\\\\" package library, as then it can't connect to TinyTex or Pandoc.  \n\n\n\n\n## RStudio as administrator  \n\nWhen you click the RStudio icon to open RStudio, do so with a right-click. Depending on your machine, you may see an option to \"Run as Administrator\". Otherwise, you may see an option to select Properties (then there should appear a window with the option \"Compatibility\", and you can select a checkbox \"Run as Administrator\").  \n\n\n\n\n## Useful commands \n\nBelow are some useful commands when trying to troubleshoot issues using R on network drives.  \n\nYou can return the path(s) to package libraries that R is using. They will be listed in the order that R is using to install/load/search for packages. Thus, if you want R to use a different default library, you can switch the order of these paths (see below).  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find libraries\n.libPaths()                   # Your library paths, listed in order that R installs/searches. \n                              # Note: all libraries will be listed, but to install to some (e.g. C:) you \n                              # may need to be running RStudio as an administrator (it won't appear in the \n                              # install packages library drop-down menu) \n```\n:::\n\n\nYou may want to switch the order of the package libraries used by R. For example if R is picking up a library location that begins with \"\\\\\\\" and one that begins with a letter e.g. \"D:\". You can adjust the order of `.libPaths()` with the following code.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Switch order of libraries\n# this can effect the priority of R finding a package. E.g. you may want your C: library to be listed first\nmyPaths <- .libPaths() # get the paths\nmyPaths <- c(myPaths[2], myPaths[1]) # switch them\n.libPaths(myPaths) # reassign them\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you are having difficulties with R Markdown connecting to Pandoc, begin with this code to find out where RStudio thinks your Pandoc installation is.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find Pandoc\nSys.getenv(\"RSTUDIO_PANDOC\")  # Find where RStudio thinks your Pandoc installation is\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you want to see which library a package is loading from, try the below code:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find a package\n# gives first location of package (note order of your libraries)\nfind.package(\"rmarkdown\", lib.loc = NULL, quiet = FALSE, verbose = getOption(\"verbose\")) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n## Troubleshooting common errors {  }\n\n\n**\"Failed to compile...tex in rmarkdown\"**  \n\n* Check the installation of TinyTex, or install TinyTex to C: location. See the [R basics] page on how to install TinyTex.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# check/install tinytex, to C: location\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\ntinytex:::is_tinytex() # should return TRUE (note three colons)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n**Internet routines cannot be loaded**  \n\nFor example, `Error in tools::startDynamicHelp() : internet routines cannot be loaded`  \n\n* Try selecting 32-bit version from RStudio via Tools/Global Options.  \n  * note: if 32-bit version does not appear in menu, make sure you are not using RStudio v1.2.  \n* Alternatively, try uninstalling R and re-installing with different bit version (32 instead of 64)\n\n\n**C: library does not appear as an option when I try to install packages manually**\n\n* Run RStudio as an administrator, then this option will appear.  \n* To set-up RStudio to always run as administrator (advantageous when using an Rproject where you don't click RStudio icon to open)... right-click the Rstudio icon \n\nThe image below shows how you can manually select the library to install a package to. This window appears when you open the Packages RStudio pane and click \"Install\".  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/network_install.png){width=148}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Pandoc 1 error**  \n\nIf you are getting \"pandoc error 1\" when knitting R Markdowns scripts on network drives:  \n\n* Of multiple library locations, have the one with a lettered drive listed first (see codes above)  \n* The above solution worked when knitting on local drive but while on a networked internet connection  \n* See more tips here: https://ciser.cornell.edu/rmarkdown-knit-to-html-word-pdf/  \n\n**Pandoc Error 83**  \n\nThe error will look something like this: `can't find file...rmarkdown...lua...`. This means that it was unable to find this file.  \n\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58830927/rmarkdown-unable-to-locate-lua-filter-when-knitting-to-word  \n\nPossibilities:  \n\n1) Rmarkdown package is not installed  \n2) Rmarkdown package is not findable  \n3) An admin rights issue.  \n\nIt is possible that R is not able to find the **rmarkdown** package file, so check which library the **rmarkdown** package lives (see code above). If the package is installed to a library that in inaccessible (e.g. starts with \"\\\\\\\") consider manually moving it to C: or other named drive library. Be aware that the **rmarkdown** package has to be able to connect to TinyTex installation, so can not live in a library on a network drive.\n\n\n**Pandoc Error 61**  \n\nFor example: `Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 61`  or `Could not fetch...`  \n\n* Try running RStudio as administrator (right click icon, select run as admin, see above instructions)  \n* Also see if the specific package that was unable to be reached can be moved to C: library.\n\n**LaTex error (see below)**\n\nAn error like: `! Package pdftex.def Error: File 'cict_qm2_2020-06-29_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png' not found: using draft setting.` or `Error: LaTeX failed to compile file_name.tex.`  \n\n* See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips.  \n* See file_name.log for more info.\n\n\n**Pandoc Error 127**  \n\nThis could be a RAM (space) issue. Re-start your R session and try again. \n\n\n**Mapping network drives**\n\nMapping a network drive can be risky. Consult with your IT department before attempting this.  \n\nA tip borrowed from this [forum discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48161177/r-markdown-openbinaryfile-does-not-exist-no-such-file-or-directory/55616529?noredirect=1#comment97966859_55616529): \n\nHow does one open a file \"through a mapped network drive\"?  \n\n* First, you'll need to know the network location you're trying to access.  \n* Next, in the Windows file manager, you will need to right click on \"This PC\" on the right hand pane, and select \"Map a network drive\".  \n* Go through the dialogue to define the network location from earlier as a lettered drive.  \n* Now you have two ways to get to the file you're opening. Using the drive-letter path should work.  \n\n\n**Error in install.packages()**  \n\nIf you get an error that includes mention of a \"lock\" directory, for example: `Error in install.packages : ERROR: failed to lock directory...`\n\nLook in your package library and you will see a folder whose name begins with \"00LOCK\". Try the following tips:  \n\n* Manually delete the \"00LOCK\" folder directory from your package library. Try installing the package again.  \n* You can also try the command `pacman::p_unlock()` (you can also put this command in the Rprofile so it runs every time project opens.). Then try installing the package again. It may take several tries.  \n* Try running RStudio in Administrator mode, and try installing the packages one-by-one.  \n* If all else fails, install the package to another library or folder (e.g. Temp) and then manually copy the package's folder over to the desired library.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
