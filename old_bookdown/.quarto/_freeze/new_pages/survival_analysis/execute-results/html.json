To determine the failure time, it is then necessary to define a time of origin (that can be the inclusion date, the date of diagnosis...). \n\nThe target of inference for survival analysis is then the time between an origin and an event.\nIn current medical research, it is widely used in clinical studies to assess the effect of a treatment for instance, or in cancer epidemiology to assess a large variety of cancer survival measures. \n\n\nIt is usually expressed through the **_survival probability_** which is the probability that the event of interest has not occurred by a duration t.\n\n\n**_Censoring_**: Censoring occurs when at the end of follow-up, some of the individuals have not had the event of interest, and thus their true time to event is unknown. We will mostly focus on right censoring here but for more details on censoring and survival analysis in general, you can see references. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n## Preparation {  }\n\n### Load packages {.unnumbered}  \n\nTo run survival analyses in R, one the most widely used package is the **survival** package. We first install it and then load it as well as the other packages that will be used in this section:\n\nIn this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThis page explores survival analyses using the linelist used in most of the previous pages and on which we apply some changes to have a proper survival data.\n\n\n### Import dataset {.unnumbered}  \n\nWe import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/epirhandbook/Epi_R_handbook/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the \"clean\" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export] page for details).  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# import linelist\nlinelist_case_data <- rio::import(\"linelist_cleaned.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data management and transformation {.unnumbered}\n\nIn short, survival data can be described as having the following three characteristics:\n\n1) the dependent variable or response is the waiting time until the occurrence of a well-defined event,\n2) observations are censored, in the sense that for some units the event of interest has not occurred at the time the data are analyzed, and \n3) there are predictors or explanatory variables whose effect on the waiting time we wish to assess or control. \n\nThus, we will create different variables needed to respect that structure and run the survival analysis.\n\nWe define:\n\n- a new data frame `linelist_surv` for this analysis  \n- our event of interest as being \"death\" (hence our survival probability will be the probability of being alive after a certain time after the time of origin),\n- the follow-up time (`futime`) as the time between the time of onset and the time of outcome *in days*,\n- censored patients as those who recovered or for whom the final outcome is not known ie the event \"death\" was not observed (`event=0`).\n\n<span style=\"color: orange;\">**_CAUTION:_** Since in a real cohort study, the information on the time of origin and the end of the follow-up is known given individuals are observed, we will remove observations where the date of onset or the date of outcome is unknown. Also the cases where the date of onset is later than the date of outcome will be removed since they are considered as wrong.</span>\n\n<span style=\"color: darkgreen;\">**_TIP:_** Given that filtering to greater than (>) or less than (<) a date can remove rows with missing values, applying the filter on the wrong dates will also remove the rows with missing dates.</span>\n\nWe then use `case_when()` to create a column `age_cat_small` in which there are only 3 age categories.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#create a new data called linelist_surv from the linelist_case_data\n\nlinelist_surv <-  linelist_case_data %>% \n     \n  dplyr::filter(\n       # remove observations with wrong or missing dates of onset or date of outcome\n       date_outcome > date_onset) %>% \n  \n  dplyr::mutate(\n       # create the event var which is 1 if the patient died and 0 if he was right censored\n       event = ifelse(is.na(outcome) | outcome == \"Recover\", 0, 1), \n    \n       # create the var on the follow-up time in days\n       futime = as.double(date_outcome - date_onset), \n    \n       # create a new age category variable with only 3 strata levels\n       age_cat_small = dplyr::case_when( \n            age_years < 5  ~ \"0-4\",\n            age_years >= 5 & age_years < 20 ~ \"5-19\",\n            age_years >= 20   ~ \"20+\"),\n       \n       # previous step created age_cat_small var as character.\n       # now convert it to factor and specify the levels.\n       # Note that the NA values remain NA's and are not put in a level \"unknown\" for example,\n       # since in the next analyses they have to be removed.\n       age_cat_small = fct_relevel(age_cat_small, \"0-4\", \"5-19\", \"20+\")\n       )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n<span style=\"color: darkgreen;\">**_TIP:_** We can verify the new columns we have created by doing a summary on the `futime` and a cross-tabulation between `event` and `outcome` from which it was created.

Other models  can also be used since the Cox model requires *important assumptions* that need to be verified for an appropriate use such as the proportional hazards assumption: see references. \n\nIn a Cox proportional hazards regression model, the measure of effect is the **_hazard rate_** (HR), which is the risk of failure (or the risk of death in our example), given that the participant has survived up to a specific time.  Usually, we are interested in comparing *independent* groups with respect to their hazards, and we use a hazard ratio, which is analogous to an odds ratio in the setting of multiple logistic regression analysis. The `cox.ph()` function from the **survival** package is used to fit the model. The function `cox.zph()` from **survival** package may be used to test the proportional hazards assumption for a Cox regression model fit. \n\n<span style=\"color: black;\">**_NOTE:_** A probability must lie in the range 0 to 1. However, the hazard represents the expected number of events per one unit of time. \n\n* If the hazard ratio for a predictor is close to 1 then that predictor does not affect survival,\n* if the HR is less than 1, then the predictor is protective (i.e., associated with improved survival),\n* and if the HR is greater than 1, then the predictor is associated with increased risk (or decreased survival).</span> \n\n### Fitting a Cox model {.unnumbered}\n\nWe can first fit a model to assess the effect of age and gender on the survival. By just printing the model, we have the information on:\n\n  + the estimated regression coefficients `coef` which quantifies the association between the predictors and the outcome,\n  + their exponential (for interpretability, `exp(coef)`) which produces the *hazard ratio*,\n  + their standard error `se(coef)`,\n  + the z-score: how many standard errors is the estimated coefficient away from  0,\n  + and the p-value:  the probability that the estimated coefficient could be 0.\n  \nThe `summary()` function applied to the cox model object gives more information, such as the confidence interval of the estimated HR and the different test scores.\n\nThe effect of the first covariate `gender`  is presented in the first row. `genderm` (male) is printed, implying that the first strata level (\"f\"), i.e the female group, is the reference group for the gender. Thus the interpretation of the test parameter is that of men compared to women. The p-value indicates there was not enough evidence of an effect of the gender on the expected hazard or of an association between gender and all-cause mortality.\n\nThe same lack of evidence is noted regarding age-group.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#fitting the cox model\nlinelistsurv_cox_sexage <-  survival::coxph(\n              Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + age_cat_small, \n              data = linelist_surv\n              )\n\n\n#printing the model fitted\nlinelistsurv_cox_sexage\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\nsurvival::coxph(formula = Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + age_cat_small, \n    data = linelist_surv)\n\n                      coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z     p\ngenderm           -0.03149   0.96900  0.04767 -0.661 0.509\nage_cat_small5-19  0.09400   1.09856  0.06454  1.456 0.145\nage_cat_small20+   0.05032   1.05161  0.06953  0.724 0.469\n\nLikelihood ratio test=2.8  on 3 df, p=0.4243\nn= 4321, number of events= 1853 \n   (218 observations deleted due to missingness)\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#summary of the model\nsummary(linelistsurv_cox_sexage)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\nsurvival::coxph(formula = Surv(futime, event) ~ gender + age_cat_small, \n    data = linelist_surv)\n\n  n= 4321, number of events= 1853 \n   (218 observations deleted due to missingness)\n\n                      coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z Pr(>|z|)\ngenderm           -0.03149   0.96900  0.04767 -0.661    0.509\nage_cat_small5-19  0.09400   1.09856  0.06454  1.456    0.145\nage_cat_small20+   0.05032   1.05161  0.06953  0.724    0.469\n\n                  exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95\ngenderm               0.969     1.0320    0.8826     1.064\nage_cat_small5-19     1.099     0.9103    0.9680     1.247\nage_cat_small20+      1.052     0.9509    0.9176     1.205\n\nConcordance= 0.514  (se = 0.007 )\nLikelihood ratio test= 2.8  on 3 df,   p=0.4\nWald test            = 2.78  on 3 df,   p=0.4\nScore (logrank) test = 2.78  on 3 df,   p=0.4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt was interesting to run the model and look at the results but a first look to verify whether the proportional hazards assumptions is respected could help saving time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntest_ph_sexage <- survival::cox.zph(linelistsurv_cox_sexage)\ntest_ph_sexage\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              chisq df    p\ngender        0.454  1 0.50\nage_cat_small 0.838  2 0.66\nGLOBAL        1.399  3 0.71\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<span style=\"color: black;\">**_NOTE:_** A second argument called *method* can be specified when computing the cox model, that determines how ties are handled.

The expected hazard is 0.9 times lower in a person who who is one day later admitted than another, holding gender constant. Or in a more straightforward explanation, a one unit increase in the duration of onset to admission is associated with a 10.7% (`coef *100`) decrease in the risk of death.\n\nResults show also a positive association between the source of infection and the all-cause mortality.

Or, what if you have a covariate that can change over time?\n\nFor example, maybe you are working with clinical data where you repeated measures of hospital laboratory values that can change over time. This is an example of a **Time Dependent Covariate**. In order to address this you need a special setup, but fortunately the cox model is very flexible and this type of data can also be modeled with tools from the **survival** package. \n\n### Time-dependent covariate setup {.unnumbered} \n\nAnalysis of time-dependent covariates in R requires setup of a special dataset. If interested, see the more detailed paper on this by the author of the **survival** package [Using Time Dependent Covariates and Time Dependent Coefficients in the Cox Model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/timedep.pdf).\n\nFor this, we'll use a new dataset from the `SemiCompRisks` package named `BMT`, which includes data on 137 bone marrow transplant patients. The variables we'll focus on are:  \n\n* `T1`  - time (in days) to death or last follow-up  \n* `delta1` - death indicator; 1-Dead, 0-Alive  \n* `TA` -  time (in days) to acute graft-versus-host disease  \n* `deltaA` -  acute graft-versus-host disease indicator;  \n  * 1 - Developed acute graft-versus-host disease  \n  * 0 - Never developed acute graft-versus-host disease\n\nWe'll load this dataset from the **survival** package using the **base** R command `data()`, which can be used for loading data that is already included in a R package that is loaded. The data frame `BMT` will appear in your R environment.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata(BMT, package = \"SemiCompRisks\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Add unique patient identifier {.unnumbered}  \n\nThere is no unique ID column in the `BMT` data, which is needed to create the type of dataset we want. So we use the function `rowid_to_column()` from the **tidyverse** package **tibble** to create a new id column called `my_id` (adds column at start of data frame with sequential row ids, starting at 1). We name the data frame `bmt`.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbmt <- rowid_to_column(BMT, \"my_id\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset now looks like this:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n:::

Expand patient rows {.unnumbered}  \n\nNext, we'll use the `tmerge()` function with the `event()` and `tdc()` helper functions to create the restructured dataset. Our goal is to restructure the dataset to create a separate row for each patient for each time interval where they have a different value for `deltaA`. In this case, each patient can have at most two rows depending on whether they developed acute graft-versus-host disease during the data collection period. We'll call our new indicator for the development of acute graft-versus-host disease `agvhd`.\n\n- `tmerge()` creates a long dataset with multiple time intervals for the different covariate values for each patient\n- `event()` creates the new event indicator to go with the newly-created time intervals\n- `tdc()` creates the time-dependent covariate column, `agvhd`, to go with the newly created time intervals\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntd_dat <- \n  tmerge(\n    data1 = bmt %>% select(my_id, T1, delta1), \n    data2 = bmt %>% select(my_id, T1, delta1, TA, deltaA), \n    id = my_id, \n    death = event(T1, delta1),\n    agvhd = tdc(TA)\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo see what this does, let's look at the data for the first 5 individual patients.\n\nThe variables of interest in the original data looked like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbmt %>% \n  select(my_id, T1, delta1, TA, deltaA) %>% \n  filter(my_id %in% seq(1, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  my_id   T1 delta1   TA deltaA\n1     1 2081      0   67      1\n2     2 1602      0 1602      0\n3     3 1496      0 1496      0\n4     4 1462      0   70      1\n5     5 1433      0 1433      0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe new dataset for these same patients looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntd_dat %>% \n  filter(my_id %in% seq(1, 5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  my_id   T1 delta1 tstart tstop death agvhd\n1     1 2081      0      0    67     0     0\n2     1 2081      0     67  2081     0     1\n3     2 1602      0      0  1602     0     0\n4     3 1496      0      0  1496     0     0\n5     4 1462      0      0    70     0     0\n6     4 1462      0     70  1462     0     1\n7     5 1433      0      0  1433     0     0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow some of our patients have two rows in the dataset corresponding to intervals where they have a different value of our new variable, `agvhd`.
