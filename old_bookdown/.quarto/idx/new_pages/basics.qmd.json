It is not intended to be a comprehensive tutorial, but it provides the basics and can be useful for refreshing your memory. The section on [Resources for learning](#learning) links to more comprehensive tutorials.\n\nParts of this page have been adapted with permission from the [R4Epis project](https://r4epis.netlify.app/).\n\nSee the page on [Transition to R] for tips on switching to R from STATA, SAS, or Excel.\n\n```{r, echo=F}\n# import the cleaned ebola linelist\nlinelist <- rio::import(here::here(\"data\", \"case_linelists\", \"linelist_cleaned.rds\"))\npacman::p_load(apyramid)\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Why use R?\n\nAs stated on the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is highly versatile, extendable, and community-driven.\n\n**Cost**\n\nR is free to use! There is a strong ethic in the community of free and open-source material.\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\nConducting your data management and analysis through a programming language (compared to Excel or another primarily point-click/manual tool) enhances **reproducibility**, makes **error-detection** easier, and eases your workload.\n\n**Community**\n\nThe R community of users is enormous and collaborative. New packages and tools to address real-life problems are developed daily, and vetted by the community of users. As one example, [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community, and is one of the largest organizations of R users. It likely has a chapter near you!\n\n## Key terms\n\n**RStudio** - RStudio is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for easier use of **R**. Read more [in the RStudio section](#rstudio).\n\n**Objects** - Everything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are *objects* which are *assigned a name* and *can be referenced* in later commands. Read more [in the Objects section](#objects).\n\n**Functions** - A function is a code operation that accept inputs and returns a transformed output. Read more [in the Functions section](#functions).\n\n**Packages** - An R package is a shareable bundle of functions. Read more [in the Packages section](#packages).\n\n**Scripts** - A script is the document file that hold your commands. Read more [in the Scripts section](#scripts)\n\n## Resources for learning {#learning}\n\n### Resources within RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\n**Help documentation**\n\nSearch the RStudio \"Help\" tab for documentation on R packages and specific functions. This is within the pane that also contains Files, Plots, and Packages (typically in the lower-right pane). As a shortcut, you can also type the name of a package or function into the R console after a question-mark to open the relevant Help page. Do not include parentheses.\n\nFor example: `?filter` or `?diagrammeR`.\n\n**Interactive tutorials**\n\nThere are several ways to learn R interactively *within* RStudio.\n\nRStudio itself offers a Tutorial pane that is powered by the [**learnr**](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/02/25/rstudio-1-3-integrated-tutorials/) R package. Simply install this package and open a tutorial via the new \"Tutorial\" tab in the upper-right RStudio pane (which also contains Environment and History tabs).\n\nThe R package [**swirl**](https://swirlstats.com/) offers interactive courses in the R Console. Install and load this package, then run the command `swirl()` (empty parentheses) in the R console. You will see prompts appear in the Console. Respond by typing in the Console. It will guide you through a course of your choice.\n\n### Cheatsheets {.unnumbered}\n\nThere are many PDF \"cheatsheets\" available on the [RStudio website](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/), for example:\n\n-   Factors with **forcats** package\\\n-   Dates and times with **lubridate** package\\\n-   Strings with **stringr** package\\\n-   iterative opertaions with **purrr** package\\\n-   Data import\\\n-   Data transformation cheatsheet with **dplyr** package\\\n-   R Markdown (to create documents like PDF, Word, Powerpoint...)\\\n-   Shiny (to build interactive web apps)\\\n-   Data visualization with **ggplot2** package\\\n-   Cartography (GIS)\\\n-   **leaflet** package (interactive maps)\\\n-   Python with R (**reticulate** package)\n\nThis is an online R resource specifically for [Excel users](https://jules32.github.io/r-for-excel-users/)\n\n### Twitter {.unnumbered}\n\nR has a vibrant twitter community where you can learn tips, shortcuts, and news - follow these accounts:\n\n-   Follow us! [\\@epiRhandbook](https://twitter.com/epirhandbook)\\\n-   R Function A Day [\\@rfuntionaday](https://twitter.com/rfunctionaday) is an *incredible* resource\\\n-   R for Data Science [\\@rstats4ds](https://twitter.com/rstats4ds?lang=en)\\\n-   RStudio [\\@RStudio](https://twitter.com/rstudio?lang=en)\\\n-   RStudio Tips [\\@rstudiotips](https://twitter.com/rstudiotips)\\\n-   R-Bloggers [\\@Rbloggers](https://twitter.com/Rbloggers)\\\n-   R-ladies [\\@RLadiesGlobal](https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal)\\\n-   Hadley Wickham [\\@hadleywickham](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n\nAlso:\n\n**\\#epitwitter** and **\\#rstats**\n\n### Free online resources {.unnumbered}\n\nA definitive text is the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\n\nThe [R4Epis](https://r4epis.netlify.app/) project website aims to \"develop standardised data cleaning, analysis and reporting tools to cover common types of outbreaks and population-based surveys that would be conducted in an MSF emergency response setting.\" You can find R basics training materials, templates for RMarkdown reports on outbreaks and surveys, and tutorials to help you set them up.\n\n### Languages other than English {.unnumbered}\n\n[Materiales de RStudio en Español](https://www.rstudio.com/collections/espanol/)\n\n[Introduction à R et au tidyverse (Francais)](https://juba.github.io/tidyverse/index.html)\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Installation\n\n### R and RStudio {.unnumbered}\n\n**How to install R**\n\nVisit this website <https://www.r-project.org/> and download the latest version of R suitable for your computer.\n\n**How to install RStudio**\n\nVisit this website <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> and download the latest free Desktop version of RStudio suitable for your computer.\n\n**Permissions**\\\nNote that you should install R and RStudio to a drive where you have read and write permissions. Otherwise, your ability to install R packages (a frequent occurrence) will be impacted. If you encounter problems, try opening RStudio by right-clicking the icon and selecting \"Run as administrator\". Other tips can be found in the page [R on network drives].\n\n**How to update R and RStudio**\n\nYour version of R is printed to the R Console at start-up. You can also run `sessionInfo()`.\n\nTo update R, go to the website mentioned above and re-install R. Alternatively, you can use the **installr** package (on Windows) by running `installr::updateR()`. This will open dialog boxes to help you download the latest R version and update your packages to the new R version. More details can be found in the **installr** [documentation](https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/installr.html).\n\nBe aware that the old R version will still exist in your computer. You can temporarily run an older version (older \"installation\") of R by clicking \"Tools\" -\\> \"Global Options\" in RStudio and choosing an R version. This can be useful if you want to use a package that has not been updated to work on the newest version of R.\n\nTo update RStudio, you can go to the website above and re-download RStudio. Another option is to click \"Help\" -\\> \"Check for Updates\" within RStudio, but this may not show the very latest updates.\n\nTo see which versions of R, RStudio, or packages were used when this Handbook as made, see the page on [Editorial and technical notes].\n\n### Other software you *may* need to install {.unnumbered}\n\n-   TinyTeX (*for compiling an RMarkdown document to PDF*)\\\n-   Pandoc (*for compiling RMarkdown documents*)\\\n-   RTools (*for building packages for R*)\\\n-   phantomjs (*for saving still images of animated networks, such as transmission chains*)\n\n#### TinyTex {.unnumbered}\n\nTinyTex is a custom LaTeX distribution, useful when trying to produce PDFs from R.\\\nSee <https://yihui.org/tinytex/> for more informaton.\n\nTo install TinyTex from R:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n# to uninstall TinyTeX, run tinytex::uninstall_tinytex()\n```\n\n#### Pandoc {.unnumbered}\n\nPandoc is a document converter, a separate software from R. **It comes bundled with RStudio and should not need to be downloaded.** It helps the process of converting Rmarkdown documents to formats like .pdf and adding complex functionality.\n\n#### RTools {.unnumbered}\n\nRTools is a collection of software for building packages for R\n\nInstall from this website: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>\n\n#### phantomjs {.unnumbered}\n\nThis is often used to take \"screenshots\" of webpages. For example when you make a transmission chain with **epicontacts** package, an HTML file is produced that is interactive and dynamic. If you want a static image, it can be useful to use the [**webshot**](https://wch.github.io/webshot/articles/intro.html) package to automate this process. This will require the external program \"phantomjs\". You can install phantomjs via the **webshot** package with the command `webshot::install_phantomjs()`.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## RStudio {#rstudio}\n\n### RStudio orientation {.unnumbered}\n\n**First, open RStudio.** As their icons can look very similar, be sure you are opening *RStudio* and not R.\n\nFor RStudio to work you must also have R installed on the computer (see above for installation instructions).\n\n**RStudio** is an interface (GUI) for easier use of **R**. You can think of R as being the engine of a vehicle, doing the crucial work, and RStudio as the body of the vehicle (with seats, accessories, etc.) that helps you actually use the engine to move forward! You can see the complete RStudio user-interface cheatsheet (PDF) [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)\n\nBy default RStudio displays four rectangle panes.\n\n```{r out.width = \"100%\", fig.align = \"center\", echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"RStudio_overview.png\"))\n```\n\n[***TIP:*** If your RStudio displays only one left pane it is because you have no scripts open yet.]{style=\"color: black;\"}\n\n**The Source Pane**\\\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is a space to edit, run, and save your [scripts](#scripts). Scripts contain the commands you want to run. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.\n\nFor Stata users, this pane is similar to your Do-file and Data Editor windows.\n\n**The R Console Pane**\n\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R \"engine\". This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. You can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script.\n\nIf you are familiar with Stata, the R Console is like the Command Window and also the Results Window.\n\n**The Environment Pane**\\\nThis pane, by default in the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of [objects](#objects) in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined (e.g. a specific epi week for the analysis), or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis (e.g. names of regions). You can click on the arrow next to a data frame name to see its variables.\n\nIn Stata, this is most similar to the Variables Manager window.\n\nThis pane also contains *History* where you can see commands that you can previously. It also has a \"Tutorial\" tab where you can complete interactive R tutorials if you have the **learnr** package installed. It also has a \"Connections\" pane for external connections, and can have a \"Git\" pane if you choose to interface with Github.\n\n**Plots, Viewer, Packages, and Help Pane**\\\nThe lower-right pane includes several important tabs. Typical plot graphics including maps will display in the Plot pane. Interactive or HTML outputs will display in the Viewer pane. The Help pane can display documentation and help files. The Files pane is a browser which can be used to open or delete files. The Packages pane allows you to see, install, update, delete, load/unload R packages, and see which version of the package you have. To learn more about packages see the [packages section](#packages) below.\n\nThis pane contains the Stata equivalents of the Plots Manager and Project Manager windows.\n\n### RStudio settings {.unnumbered}\n\nChange RStudio settings and appearance in the *Tools* drop-down menu, by selecting *Global Options*. There you can change the default settings, including appearance/background color.\n\n```{r out.width = c('50%'), fig.show='hold', echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"RStudio_tools_options_1.png\"))\n\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"RStudio_tools_options.png\"))\n```\n\n**Restart**\n\nIf your R freezes, you can re-start R by going to the Session menu and clicking \"Restart R\". This avoids the hassle of closing and opening RStudio. Everything in your R environment will be removed when you do this.\n\n### Keyboard shortcuts {.unnumbered}\n\nSome very useful keyboard shortcuts are below. See all the keyboard shortcuts for Windows, Max, and Linux in the second page of this RStudio [user interface cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf).\n\n+----------------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|

Use your Tab key when typing to engage RStudio's auto-complete functionality. This can prevent spelling errors. Press Tab while typing to produce a drop-down menu of likely functions and objects, based on what you have typed so far.]{style=\"color: darkgreen;\"}\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Functions {#functions}\n\nFunctions are at the core of using R. Functions are how you perform tasks and operations. Many functions come installed with R, many more are available for download in *packages* (explained in the [packages](#packages) section), and you can even write your own custom functions!\n\nThis basics section on functions explains:\n\n-   What a function is and how they work\\\n-   What function *arguments* are\\\n-   How to get help understanding a function\n\n*A quick note on syntax:* In this handbook, functions are written in code-text with open parentheses, like this: `filter()`. As explained in the [packages](#packages) section, functions are downloaded within *packages*. In this handbook, package names are written in **bold**, like **dplyr**. Sometimes in example code you may see the function name linked explicitly to the name of its package with two colons (`::`) like this: `dplyr::filter()`. The purpose of this linkage is explained in the packages section.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Simple functions {.unnumbered}\n\n**A function is like a machine that receives inputs, does some action with those inputs, and produces an output.** What the output is depends on the function.\n\n**Functions typically operate upon some object placed within the function's parentheses**. For example, the function `sqrt()` calculates the square root of a number:\n\n```{r basics_function_sqrt}\nsqrt(49)\n```\n\nThe object provided to a function also can be a column in a dataset (see the [Objects](#objects) section for detail on all the kinds of objects). Because R can store multiple datasets, you will need to specify both the dataset and the column. One way to do this is using the `$` notation to link the name of the dataset and the name of the column (`dataset$column`). In the example below, the function `summary()` is applied to the numeric column `age` in the dataset `linelist`, and the output is a summary of the column's numeric and missing values.\n\n```{r basics_functions_summary}\n# Print summary statistics of column 'age' in the dataset 'linelist'\nsummary(linelist$age)\n```\n\n[***NOTE:*** Behind the scenes, a function represents complex additional code that has been wrapped up for the user into one easy command.]{style=\"color: black;\"}\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Functions with multiple arguments {.unnumbered}\n\nFunctions often ask for several inputs, called ***arguments***, located within the parentheses of the function, usually separated by commas.\n\n-   Some arguments are required for the function to work correctly, others are optional\\\n-   Optional arguments have default settings\\\n-   Arguments can take character, numeric, logical (TRUE/FALSE), and other inputs\n\nHere is a fun fictional function, called `oven_bake()`, as an example of a typical function. It takes an input object (e.g. a dataset, or in this example \"dough\") and performs operations on it as specified by additional arguments (`minutes =` and `temperature =`). The output can be printed to the console, or saved as an object using the assignment operator `<-`.\n\n```{r basics_functions_image, echo=F, out.width = \"75%\", fig.align = \"center\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"Function_Bread_Example.png\"))\n```\n\n**In a more realistic example**, the `age_pyramid()` command below produces an age pyramid plot based on defined age groups and a binary split column, such as `gender`. The function is given three arguments within the parentheses, separated by commas. The values supplied to the arguments establish `linelist` as the dataframe to use, `age_cat5` as the column to count, and `gender` as the binary column to use for splitting the pyramid by color.\n\n```{r basics_functions_arguments, include=FALSE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,}\n## create an age group variable by specifying categorical breaks\nlinelist$age_group <- cut(linelist$age, breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60))\n```\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\"}\n# Create an age pyramid\nage_pyramid(data = linelist, age_group = \"age_cat5\", split_by = \"gender\")\n```\n\nThe above command can be equivalently written as below, in a longer style with a new line for each argument. This style can be easier to read, and easier to write \"comments\" with `#` to explain each part (commenting extensively is good practice!). To run this longer command you can highlight the entire command and click \"Run\", or just place your cursor in the first line and then press the Ctrl and Enter keys simultaneously.\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\"}\n# Create an age pyramid\nage_pyramid(\n  data = linelist,        # use case linelist\n  age_group = \"age_cat5\", # provide age group column\n  split_by = \"gender\"     # use gender column for two sides of pyramid\n  )\n```\n\nThe first half of an argument assignment (e.g. `data =`) does not need to be specified if the arguments are written in a specific order (specified in the function's documentation). The below code produces the exact same pyramid as above, because the function expects the argument order: data frame, `age_group` variable, `split_by` variable.\n\n```{r, basics_functions_pyramid2, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, , out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\", eval=F}\n# This command will produce the exact same graphic as above\nage_pyramid(linelist, \"age_cat5\", \"gender\")\n```\n\n**A more complex `age_pyramid()` command might include the *optional* arguments to:**\n\n-   Show proportions instead of counts (set `proportional = TRUE` when the default is `FALSE`)\\\n-   Specify the two colors to use (`pal =` is short for \"palette\" and is supplied with a vector of two color names. See the [objects](#objectstructure) page for how the function `c()` makes a vector)\n\n[***NOTE:*** For arguments that you specify with both parts of the argument (e.g. `proportional = TRUE`), their order among all the arguments does not matter.]{style=\"color: black;\"}\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\"}\nage_pyramid(\n  linelist,                    # use case linelist\n  \"age_cat5\",                  # age group column\n  \"gender\",                    # split by gender\n  proportional = TRUE,         # percents instead of counts\n  pal = c(\"orange\", \"purple\")  # colors\n  )\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Writing Functions {.unnumbered}\n\nR is a language that is oriented around functions, so you should feel empowered to write your own functions. Creating functions brings several advantages:\n\n-   To facilitate modular programming - the separation of code in to independent and manageable pieces\\\n-   Replace repetitive copy-and-paste, which can be error prone\\\n-   Give pieces of code memorable names\n\nHow to write a function is covered in-depth in the [Writing functions] page.\n\n<!-- A function is given a name and defined with the assignment operator `<-` to a special **base** R function called `function()`. Within the parentheses, the arguments that the function will accept are defined. This is followed by curly brackets `{ }`, within which the actual code of the function is written.     -->\n\n```{r, eval=F, echo=F}\nmy_function <- function( ARGUMENTS HERE ){ CODE HERE }\n```\n\n<!-- The arguments should be provided in the syntax `argument = default`, separated by commas.   -->\n\n<!-- Here is an example where we create a function `staff_calc()` to serve as a staffing calculator for COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing calls.   -->\n\n<!-- The arguments (inputs) and their default values will be:   -->\n\n<!-- * `daily_cases = NULL` The number of new COVID-19 cases per day   -->\n\n<!-- * `contacts_each = 5` The number contacts enumerated for each case   -->\n\n<!-- * `time_case = 0.5`  Number of hours to complete a case investigaton by phone   -->\n\n<!-- * `time_contact = 0.25`  Number of hours to complete a contact follow-up by phone   -->\n\n<!-- * `time_day = 8` The number of hours one staff works per day   -->\n\n<!-- Below, the function is created. The code ends with the special function `return()`, which is what the function produces.    -->\n\n<!-- ```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\"} -->\n\n<!-- staff_calc <- function(daily_cases = NULL, contacts_each = 5, -->\n\n<!--                        time_case = 0.5, time_contact = 0.25, time_day = 8){ -->\n\n<!--   # Define total daily hours for calling cases -->\n\n<!--   case_hours <- daily_cases * time_case  -->\n\n<!--   # Define total daily hours for calling contacts -->\n\n<!--   contact_hours <- daily_cases * contacts_each * time_contact -->\n\n<!--   # Calculate number of staff required -->\n\n<!--   staff_required <- (case_hours + contact_hours)/time_day -->\n\n<!--   return(staff_required) -->\n\n<!-- } -->\n\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- Once this code is run, the function will be defined and will appear in the R Environment. We can run the function. Below all the default values are used and the `daily_cases = ` is set to 150.   -->\n\n```{r eval=F, echo=F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"75%\"}\nstaff_calc(daily_cases = 150)\n```\n\n```{r, eval=F, echo=F}\ncase_incidence <- tibble(\n  dates = seq.Date(from = as.Date(\"2020-05-01\"), to = as.Date(\"2020-05-21\"), by = 1),\n  projected_incidence = c(102,110,50,37,106,190,146,138,135,111,60,43,189,184,185,80,44,97,254,291,288),\n  staff_needed = staff_calc(projected_incidence)\n)\n\nggplot(case_incidence, aes(x = dates))+\n  geom_line(aes(y = projected_incidence))+\n  geom_line(aes(y = staff_needed))\n```\n\n<!-- There are many other nuances to understand when writing functions, as discussed in the page [Writing functions].   -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Packages {#packages}\n\n**Packages contain functions.**\n\nAn R package is a shareable bundle of code and documentation that contains pre-defined functions. Users in the R community develop packages all the time catered to specific problems, it is likely that one can help with your work! You will install and use hundreds of packages in your use of R.\n\nOn installation, R contains **\"base\"** packages and functions that perform common elementary tasks. But many R users create specialized functions, which are verified by the R community and which you can download as a **package** for your own use. In this handbook, package names are written in **bold**. One of the more challenging aspects of R is that there are often many functions or packages to choose from to complete a given task.\n\n### Install and load {.unnumbered}\n\n*Functions* are contained within **packages** which can be downloaded (\"installed\") to your computer from the internet. Once a package is downloaded, it is stored in your \"library\". You can then access the functions it contains during your current R session by \"loading\" the package.\n\n*Think of R as your personal library*: When you download a package, your library gains a new book of functions, but each time you want to use a function in that book, you must borrow (\"load\") that book from your library.\n\nIn summary: to use the functions available in an R package, 2 steps must be implemented:\n\n1)  The package must be **installed** (once), *and*\\\n2)  The package must be **loaded** (each R session)\n\n#### Your library {.unnumbered}\n\nYour \"library\" is actually a folder on your computer, containing a folder for each package that has been installed. Find out where R is installed in your computer, and look for a folder called \"win-library\". For example: `R\\win-library\\4.0` (the 4.0 is the R version - you'll have a different library for each R version you've downloaded).\n\nYou can print the file path to your library by entering `.libPaths()` (empty parentheses). This becomes especially important if working with [R on network drives].\n\n#### Install from CRAN {.unnumbered}\n\nMost often, R users download packages from CRAN. CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) is an online public warehouse of R packages that have been published by R community members.\n\nAre you worried about viruses and security when downloading a package from CRAN? Read [this article](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042593974-R-and-R-Package-Security) on the topic.\n\n#### How to install and load {.unnumbered}\n\nIn this handbook, we suggest using the **pacman** package (short for \"package manager\"). It offers a convenient function `p_load()` which will install a package if necessary *and* load it for use in the current R session.\n\nThe syntax quite simple. Just list the names of the packages within the `p_load()` parentheses, separated by commas. This command will install the **rio**, **tidyverse**, and **here** packages if they are not yet installed, and will load them for use. This makes the `p_load()` approach convenient and concise if sharing scripts with others. Note that package names are case-sensitive.\n\n```{r}\n# Install (if necessary) and load packages for use\npacman::p_load(rio, tidyverse, here)\n```\n\nNote that we have used the syntax `pacman::p_load()` which explicitly writes the package name (**pacman**) prior to the function name (`p_load()`), connected by two colons `::`. This syntax is useful because it also loads the **pacman** package (assuming it is already installed).\n\nThere are alternative **base** R functions that you will see often. The **base** R function for installing a package is `install.packages()`. The name of the package to install must be provided in the parentheses *in quotes*. If you want to install multiple packages in one command, they must be listed within a character vector `c()`.\n\nNote: this command *installs* a package, but does *not* load it for use in the current session.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# install a single package with base R\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n# install multiple packages with base R\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"rio\", \"here\"))\n```\n\nInstallation can also be accomplished point-and-click by going to the RStudio \"Packages\" pane and clicking \"Install\" and searching for the desired package name.\n\nThe **base** R function to **load** a package for use (after it has been installed) is `library()`. It can load only one package at a time (another reason to use `p_load()`). You can provide the package name with or without quotes.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# load packages for use, with base R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rio)\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\nTo check whether a package in installed and/or loaded, you can view the Packages pane in RStudio. If the package is installed, it is shown there with version number. If its box is checked, it is loaded for the current session.\n\n**Install from Github**\n\nSometimes, you need to install a package that is not yet available from CRAN. Or perhaps the package is available on CRAN but you want the *development version* with new features not yet offered in the more stable published CRAN version. These are often hosted on the website [github.com](https://github.com/) in a free, public-facing code \"repository\". Read more about Github in the handbook page on [Version control and collaboration with Git and Github].\n\nTo download R packages from Github, you can use the function `p_load_gh()` from **pacman**, which will install the package if necessary, and load it for use in your current R session. Alternatives to install include using the **remotes** or **devtools** packages. Read more about all the **pacman** functions in the [package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/pacman.pdf).\n\nTo install from Github, you have to provide more information. You must provide:\n\n1)  The Github ID of the repository owner\n2)  The name of the repository that contains the package\\\n3)  *(optional) The name of the \"branch\" (specific development version) you want to download*\n\nIn the examples below, the first word in the quotation marks is the Github ID of the repository owner, after the slash is the name of the repository (the name of the package).\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# install/load the epicontacts package from its Github repository\np_load_gh(\"reconhub/epicontacts\")\n```\n\nIf you want to install from a \"branch\" (version) other than the main branch, add the branch name after an \"\\@\", after the repository name.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# install the \"timeline\" branch of the epicontacts package from Github\np_load_gh(\"reconhub/epicontacts@timeline\")\n```\n\nIf there is no difference between the Github version and the version on your computer, no action will be taken. You can \"force\" a re-install by instead using `p_load_current_gh()` with the argument `update = TRUE`. Read more about **pacman** in this [online vignette](http://trinker.github.io/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html)\n\n**Install from ZIP or TAR**\n\nYou could install the package from a URL:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\npackageurl <- \"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/dsr/dsr_0.2.2.tar.gz\"\ninstall.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\n```\n\nOr, download it to your computer in a zipped file:\n\nOption 1: using `install_local()` from the **remotes** package\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nremotes::install_local(\"~/Downloads/dplyr-master.zip\")\n```\n\nOption 2: using `install.packages()` from **base** R, providing the file path to the ZIP file and setting `type = \"source` and `repos = NULL`.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\ninstall.packages(\"~/Downloads/dplyr-master.zip\", repos=NULL, type=\"source\")\n```\n\n### Code syntax {.unnumbered}\n\nFor clarity in this handbook, functions are sometimes preceded by the name of their package using the `::` symbol in the following way: `package_name::function_name()`\n\nOnce a package is loaded for a session, this explicit style is not necessary. One can just use `function_name()`. However writing the package name is useful when a function name is common and may exist in multiple packages (e.g. `plot()`). Writing the package name will also load the package if it is not already loaded.\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# This command uses the package \"rio\" and its function \"import()\" to import a dataset\nlinelist <- rio::import(\"linelist.xlsx\", which = \"Sheet1\")\n```\n\n### Function help {.unnumbered}\n\nTo read more about a function, you can search for it in the Help tab of the lower-right RStudio. You can also run a command like `?thefunctionname` (put the name of the function after a question mark) and the Help page will appear in the Help pane. Finally, try searching online for resources.\n\n### Update packages {.unnumbered}\n\nYou can update packages by re-installing them. You can also click the green \"Update\" button in your RStudio Packages pane to see which packages have new versions to install. Be aware that your old code may need to be updated if there is a major revision to how a function works!\n\n### Delete packages {.unnumbered}\n\nUse `p_delete()` from **pacman**, or `remove.packages()` from **base** R. Alternatively, go find the folder which contains your library and manually delete the folder.\n\n### Dependencies {.unnumbered}\n\nPackages often depend on other packages to work. These are called dependencies. If a dependency fails to install, then the package depending on it may also fail to install.\n\nSee the dependencies of a package with `p_depends()`, and see which packages depend on it with `p_depends_reverse()`\n\n### Masked functions {.unnumbered}\n\nIt is not uncommon that two or more packages contain the same function name. For example, the package **dplyr** has a `filter()` function, but so does the package **stats**. The default `filter()` function depends on the order these packages are first loaded in the R session - the later one will be the default for the command `filter()`.\n\nYou can check the order in your Environment pane of R Studio - click the drop-down for \"Global Environment\" and see the order of the packages. Functions from packages *lower* on that drop-down list will mask functions of the same name in packages that appear higher in the drop-down list. When first loading a package, R will warn you in the console if masking is occurring, but this can be easy to miss.\n\n```{r out.width = \"50%\", fig.align = \"center\", echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"masking_functions.png\"))\n```\n\nHere are ways you can fix masking:\n\n1)  Specify the package name in the command. For example, use `dplyr::filter()`\\\n2)  Re-arrange the order in which the packages are loaded (e.g. within `p_load()`), and **start a new R session**\n\n### Detach / unload {.unnumbered}\n\nTo detach (unload) a package, use this command, with the correct package name and only one colon. Note that this may not resolve masking.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\ndetach(package:PACKAGE_NAME_HERE, unload=TRUE)\n```\n\n### Install older version {.unnumbered}\n\nSee this [guide](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/219949047-Installing-older-versions-of-packages) to install an older version of a particular package.\n\n### Suggested packages {.unnumbered}\n\nSee the page on [Suggested packages] for a listing of packages we recommend for everyday epidemiology.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Scripts {#scripts}\n\nScripts are a fundamental part of programming. They are documents that hold your commands (e.g. functions to create and modify datasets, print visualizations, etc). You can save a script and run it again later. There are many advantages to storing and running your commands from a script (vs. typing commands one-by-one into the R console \"command line\"):\n\n-   Portability - you can share your work with others by sending them your scripts\\\n-   Reproducibility - so that you and others know exactly what you did\\\n-   Version control - so you can track changes made by yourself or colleagues\\\n-   Commenting/annotation - to explain to your colleagues what you have done\n\n### Commenting {.unnumbered}\n\nIn a script you can also annotate (\"comment\") around your R code. Commenting is helpful to explain to yourself and other readers what you are doing. You can add a comment by typing the hash symbol (\\#) and writing your comment after it. The commented text will appear in a different color than the R code.\n\nAny code written after the \\# will not be run. Therefore, placing a \\# before code is also a useful way to temporarily block a line of code (\"comment out\") if you do not want to delete it). You can comment out/in multiple lines at once by highlighting them and pressing Ctrl+Shift+c (Cmd+Shift+c in Mac).\n\n```{r, eval = F}\n# A comment can be on a line by itself\n# import data\nlinelist <- import(\"linelist_raw.xlsx\") %>%   # a comment can also come after code\n# filter(age > 50)                          # It can also be used to deactivate / remove a line of code\n  count()\n\n```\n\n-   Comment on *what* you are doing *and on **why** you are doing it*.\\\n-   Break your code into logical sections\\\n-   Accompany your code with a text step-by-step description of what you are doing (e.g. numbered steps)\n\n### Style {.unnumbered}\n\nIt is important to be conscious of your coding style - especially if working on a team. We advocate for the **tidyverse** [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). There are also packages such as **styler** and **lintr** which help you conform to this style.\n\nA few very basic points to make your code readable to others:\\\n\\* When naming objects, use only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores `_`, e.g. `my_data`\\\n\\* Use frequent spaces, including around operators, e.g. `n = 1` and `age_new <- age_old + 3`\n\n### Example Script {.unnumbered}\n\nBelow is an example of a short R script. Remember, the better you succinctly explain your code in comments, the more your colleagues will like you!\n\n```{r out.width = \"100%\", fig.align = \"center\", echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"example_script.png\"))\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### R markdown {.unnumbered}\n\nAn R markdown script is a type of R script in which the script itself *becomes* an output document (PDF, Word, HTML, Powerpoint, etc.). These are incredibly useful and versatile tools often used to create dynamic and automated reports. Even this website and handbook is produced with R markdown scripts!\n\nIt is worth noting that beginner R users can also use R Markdown - do not be intimidated! To learn more, see the handbook page on [Reports with R Markdown] documents.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### R notebooks {.unnumbered}\n\nThere is no difference between writing in a Rmarkdown vs an R notebook. However the execution of the document differs slightly. See this [site](http://uc-r.github.io/r_notebook) for more details.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Shiny {.unnumbered}\n\nShiny apps/websites are contained within one script, which must be named `app.R`. This file has three components:\n\n1)  A user interface (ui)\\\n2)  A server function\\\n3)  A call to the `shinyApp` function\n\nSee the handbook page on [Dashboards with Shiny], or this online tutorial: [Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/)\n\n*In older times, the above file was split into two files (`ui.R` and `server.R`)*\n\n### Code folding {.unnumbered}\n\nYou can collapse portions of code to make your script easier to read.\n\nTo do this, create a text header with \\#, write your header, and follow it with at least 4 of either dashes (-), hashes (\\#) or equals (=). When you have done this, a small arrow will appear in the \"gutter\" to the left (by the row number). You can click this arrow and the code below until the next header will collapse and a dual-arrow icon will appear in its place.\n\nTo expand the code, either click the arrow in the gutter again, or the dual-arrow icon. There are also keyboard shortcuts as explained in the [RStudio section](#rstudio) of this page.\n\nBy creating headers with \\#, you will also activate the Table of Contents at the bottom of your script (see below) that you can use to navigate your script. You can create sub-headers by adding more \\# symbols, for example \\# for primary, \\#\\# for seconary, and \\#\\#\\# for tertiary headers.\n\nBelow are two versions of an example script. On the left is the original with commented headers. On the right, four dashes have been written after each header, making them collapsible. Two of them have been collapsed, and you can see that the Table of Contents at the bottom now shows each section.\n\n```{r, out.width = c('50%'), fig.show='hold', echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"code_folding1.png\"))\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"code_folding2.png\"))\n```\n\nOther areas of code that are automatically eligible for folding include \"braced\" regions with brackets `{ }` such as function definitions or conditional blocks (if else statements). You can read more about code folding at the RStudio [site](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections).\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Working directory\n\nThe working directory is the root folder location used by R for your work - where R looks for and saves files by default. By default, it will save new files and outputs to this location, and will look for files to import (e.g. datasets) here as well.\n\nThe working directory appears in grey text at the top of the RStudio Console pane. You can also print the current working directory by running `getwd()` (leave the parentheses empty).\n\n```{r out.width = \"100%\", fig.align = \"center\", echo=F}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"working_directory_1.png\"))\n```\n\n### Recommended approach {.unnumbered}\n\n**See the page on [R projects] for details on our recommended approach to managing your working directory.**\\\nA common, efficient, and trouble-free way to manage your working directory and file paths is to combine these 3 elements in an [R project][R projects]-oriented workflow:\n\n1)  An R Project to store all your files (see page on [R projects])\\\n2)  The **here** package to locate files (see page on [Import and export])\\\n3)  The **rio** package to import/export files (see page on [Import and export])\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Set by command {.unnumbered}\n\nUntil recently, many people learning R were taught to begin their scripts with a `setwd()` command. Please instead consider using an [R project][R projects]-oriented workflow and read the [reasons for not using `setwd()`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). In brief, your work becomes specific to your computer, file paths used to import and export files become \"brittle\", and this severely hinders collaboration and use of your code on any other computer. There are easy alternatives!\n\nAs noted above, although we do not recommend this approach in most circumstances, you can use the command `setwd()` with the desired folder file path in quotations, for example:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nsetwd(\"C:/Documents/R Files/My analysis\")\n```\n\n[***DANGER:*** Setting a working directory with `setwd()` *can* be \"brittle\" if the file path is specific to one computer. Instead, use file paths relative to an R Project root directory (with the **here** package). ]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Set manually {.unnumbered}\n\nTo set the working directory manually (the point-and-click equivalent of `setwd()`), click the Session drop-down menu and go to \"Set Working Directory\" and then \"Choose Directory\". This will set the working directory for that specific R session. Note: if using this approach, you will have to do this manually each time you open RStudio.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Within an R project {.unnumbered}\n\nIf using an R project, the working directory will default to the R project root folder that contains the \".rproj\" file. This will apply if you open RStudio by clicking open the R Project (the file with \".rproj\" extension).\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Working directory in an R markdown {.unnumbered}\n\nIn an R markdown script, the default working directory is the folder the Rmarkdown file (`.Rmd`) is saved within. If using an R project and **here** package, this does not apply and the working directory will be `here()` as explained in the [R projects] page.\n\nIf you want to change the working directory of a stand-alone R markdown (not in an R project), if you use `setwd()` this will only apply to that specific code chunk. To make the change for all code chunks in an R markdown, edit the setup chunk to add the `root.dir =` parameter, such as below:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nknitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = 'desired/directorypath')\n```\n\nIt is much easier to just use the R markdown within an R project and use the **here** package.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Providing file paths {.unnumbered}\n\nPerhaps the most common source of frustration for an R beginner (at least on a Windows machine) is typing in a file path to import or export data. There is a thorough explanation of how to best input file paths in the [Import and export] page, but here are a few key points:\n\n**Broken paths**\n\nBelow is an example of an \"absolute\" or \"full address\" file path. These will likely break if used by another computer. One exception is if you are using a shared/network drive.\n\n    C:/Users/Name/Document/Analytic Software/R/Projects/Analysis2019/data/March2019.csv  \n\n**Slash direction**\n\n*If typing in a file path, be aware the direction of the slashes.* Use *forward slashes* (`/`) to separate the components (\"data/provincial.csv\"). For Windows users, the default way that file paths are displayed is with *back slashes* (\\\\) - so you will need to change the direction of each slash. If you use the **here** package as described in the [R projects] page the slash direction is not an issue.\n\n**Relative file paths**\n\nWe generally recommend providing \"relative\" filepaths instead - that is, the path *relative to* the root of your R Project. You can do this using the **here** package as explained in the [R projects] page. A relativel filepath might look like this:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# Import csv linelist from the data/linelist/clean/ sub-folders of an R project\nlinelist <- import(here(\"data\", \"clean\", \"linelists\", \"marin_country.csv\"))\n```\n\nEven if using relative file paths within an R project, you can still use absolute paths to import/export data outside your R project.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Objects {#objects}\n\nEverything in R is an object, and R is an \"object-oriented\" language. These sections will explain:\n\n-   How to create objects (`<-`)\n-   Types of objects (e.g. data frames, vectors..)\\\n-   How to access subparts of objects (e.g. variables in a dataset)\\\n-   Classes of objects (e.g. numeric, logical, integer, double, character, factor)\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Everything is an object {.unnumbered}\n\n*This section is adapted from the [R4Epis project](https://r4epis.netlify.app/training/r_basics/objects/).*\\\nEverything you store in R - datasets, variables, a list of village names, a total population number, even outputs such as graphs - are **objects** which are **assigned a name** and **can be referenced** in later commands.\n\nAn object exists when you have assigned it a value (see the assignment section below). When it is assigned a value, the object appears in the Environment (see the upper right pane of RStudio). It can then be operated upon, manipulated, changed, and re-defined.\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Defining objects (`<-`) {.unnumbered}\n\n**Create objects *by assigning them a value* with the \\<- operator.**\\\nYou can think of the assignment operator `<-` as the words \"is defined as\". Assignment commands generally follow a standard order:\n\n**object_name** \\<- **value** (or process/calculation that produce a value)\n\nFor example, you may want to record the current epidemiological reporting week as an object for reference in later code. In this example, the object `current_week` is created when it is assigned the value `\"2018-W10\"` (the quote marks make this a character value). The object `current_week` will then appear in the RStudio Environment pane (upper-right) and can be referenced in later commands.\n\nSee the R commands and their output in the boxes below.\n\n```{r basics_objects_assignment}\ncurrent_week <- \"2018-W10\"   # this command creates the object current_week by assigning it a value\ncurrent_week                 # this command prints the current value of current_week object in the console\n```\n\n[***NOTE:*** Note the `[1]` in the R console output is simply indicating that you are viewing the first item of the output]{style=\"color: black;\"}\n\n[***CAUTION:*** **An object's value can be over-written** at any time by running an assignment command to re-define its value. Thus, the **order of the commands run is very important**.]{style=\"color: orange;\"}\n\nThe following command will re-define the value of `current_week`:\n\n```{r basics_objects_reassignment}\ncurrent_week <- \"2018-W51\"   # assigns a NEW value to the object current_week\ncurrent_week                 # prints the current value of current_week in the console\n```\n\n**Equals signs `=`**\n\nYou will also see equals signs in R code:\n\n-   A double equals sign `==` between two objects or values asks a logical *question*: \"is this equal to that?\".\\\n-   You will also see equals signs within functions used to specify values of function arguments (read about these in sections below), for example `max(age, na.rm = TRUE)`.\\\n-   You *can* use a single equals sign `=` in place of `<-` to create and define objects, but this is discouraged. You can read about why this is discouraged [here](https://renkun.me/2014/01/28/difference-between-assignment-operators-in-r/).\n\n**Datasets**\n\nDatasets are also objects (typically \"dataframes\") and must be assigned names when they are imported. In the code below, the object `linelist` is created and assigned the value of a CSV file imported with the **rio** package and its `import()` function.\n\n```{r basics_objects_dataframes, eval=FALSE}\n# linelist is created and assigned the value of the imported CSV file\nlinelist <- import(\"my_linelist.csv\")\n```\n\nYou can read more about importing and exporting datasets with the section on [Import and export].\n\n[***CAUTION:*** A quick note on naming of objects:]{style=\"color: orange;\"}\n\n-   Object names must not contain spaces, but you should use underscore (\\_) or a period (.) instead of a space.\\\n-   Object names are case-sensitive (meaning that Dataset_A is different from dataset_A).\n-   Object names must begin with a letter (cannot begin with a number like 1, 2 or 3).\n\n**Outputs**\n\nOutputs like tables and plots provide an example of how outputs can be saved as objects, or just be printed without being saved. A cross-tabulation of gender and outcome using the **base** R function `table()` can be printed directly to the R console (*without* being saved).\n\n```{r}\n# printed to R console only\ntable(linelist$gender, linelist$outcome)\n```\n\nBut the same table can be saved as a named object. Then, optionally, it can be printed.\n\n```{r}\n# save\ngen_out_table <- table(linelist$gender, linelist$outcome)\n\n# print\ngen_out_table\n```\n\n**Columns**\n\nColumns in a dataset are also objects and can be defined, over-written, and created as described below in the section on Columns.\n\nYou can use the assignment operator from **base** R to create a new column. Below, the new column `bmi` (Body Mass Index) is created, and for each row the new value is result of a mathematical operation on the row's value in the `wt_kg` and `ht_cm` columns.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# create new \"bmi\" column using base R syntax\nlinelist$bmi <- linelist$wt_kg / (linelist$ht_cm/100)^2\n```\n\nHowever, in this handbook, we emphasize a different approach to defining columns, which uses the function `mutate()` from the **dplyr** package and *piping* with the pipe operator (`%>%`). The syntax is easier to read and there are other advantages explained in the page on [Cleaning data and core functions]. You can read more about *piping* in the Piping section below.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# create new \"bmi\" column using dplyr syntax\nlinelist <- linelist %>% \n  mutate(bmi = wt_kg / (ht_cm/100)^2)\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Object structure {.unnumbered}\n\n**Objects can be a single piece of data (e.g. `my_number <- 24`), or they can consist of structured data.**\n\nThe graphic below is borrowed from [this online R tutorial](http://venus.ifca.unican.es/Rintro/dataStruct.html). It shows some common data structures and their names. Not included in this image is spatial data, which is discussed in the [GIS basics] page.\n\n```{r basics_objects_structures, echo=F, out.width = \"75%\", out.height=\"50%\", fig.align = \"center\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"R_data_structures.png\"))\n```\n\nIn epidemiology (and particularly field epidemiology), you will *most commonly* encounter data frames and vectors:\n\n+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Common structure | Explanation                                                                                      | Example                                                                             |\n+==================+==================================================================================================+=====================================================================================+\n| Vectors          | A container for a sequence of singular objects, all of the same class (e.g. numeric, character). | **\"Variables\" (columns) in data frames are vectors** (e.g. the column `age_years`). |\n+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Data Frames      | Vectors (e.g. columns) that are bound together that all have the same number of rows.            | `linelist` is a data frame.                                                         |\n+------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nNote that to create a vector that \"stands alone\" (is not part of a data frame) the function `c()` is used to combine the different elements. For example, if creating a vector of colors plot's color scale: `vector_of_colors <- c(\"blue\", \"red2\", \"orange\", \"grey\")`\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Object classes {.unnumbered}\n\nAll the objects stored in R have a *class* which tells R how to handle the object.

Note: you can reference a specific column within a dataset using the `$` notation to separate the name of the dataset and the name of the column.\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE,}\nclass(linelist)         # class should be a data frame or tibble\n\nclass(linelist$age)     # class should be numeric\n\nclass(linelist$gender)  # class should be character\n```\n\nSometimes, a column will be converted to a different class automatically by R. Watch out for this! For example, if you have a vector or column of numbers, but a character value is inserted... the entire column will change to class character.\n\n```{r}\nnum_vector <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # define vector as all numbers\nclass(num_vector)          # vector is numeric class\nnum_vector[3] <- \"three\"   # convert the third element to a character\nclass(num_vector)          # vector is now character class\n```\n\nOne common example of this is when manipulating a data frame in order to print a table - if you make a total row and try to paste/glue together percents in the same cell as numbers (e.g. `23 (40%)`), the entire numeric column above will convert to character and can no longer be used for mathematical calculations.**Sometimes, you will need to convert objects or columns to another class.**\n\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Function         | Action                                                                                |\n+==================+=======================================================================================+\n| `as.character()` | Converts to character class                                                           |\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `as.numeric()`   | Converts to numeric class                                                             |\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `as.integer()`   | Converts to integer class                                                             |\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `as.Date()`      | Converts to Date class - Note: see section on [dates](#dates) for details             |\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| `factor()`       | Converts to factor - Note: re-defining order of value levels requires extra arguments |\n+------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nLikewise, there are **base** R functions to check whether an object IS of a specific class, such as `is.numeric()`, `is.character()`, `is.double()`, `is.factor()`, `is.integer()`\n\nHere is [more online material on classes and data structures in R](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/13-supp-data-structures/).\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Columns/Variables (`$`) {.unnumbered}\n\n**A column in a data frame is technically a \"vector\" (see table above)** - a series of values that must all be the same class (either character, numeric, logical, etc).\n\nA vector can exist independent of a data frame, for example a vector of column names that you want to include as explanatory variables in a model. To create a \"stand alone\" vector, use the `c()` function as below:\n\n```{r, warning=F, message=F}\n# define the stand-alone vector of character values\nexplanatory_vars <- c(\"gender\", \"fever\", \"chills\", \"cough\", \"aches\", \"vomit\")\n\n# print the values in this named vector\nexplanatory_vars\n```\n\n**Columns in a data frame are also vectors and can be called, referenced, extracted, or created using the `$` symbol.** The `$` symbol connects the name of the column to the name of its data frame. In this handbook, we try to use the word \"column\" instead of \"variable\".\n\n```{r basics_objects_call, eval=F}\n# Retrieve the length of the vector age_years\nlength(linelist$age) # (age is a column in the linelist data frame)\n\n```\n\nBy typing the name of the dataframe followed by `$` you will also see a drop-down menu of all columns in the data frame. You can scroll through them using your arrow key, select one with your Enter key, and avoid spelling mistakes!\n\n```{r echo=F, out.width = \"100%\", fig.align = \"center\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(here::here(\"images\", \"Calling_Names.gif\"))\n```\n\n[***ADVANCED TIP:*** Some more complex objects (e.g. a list, or an `epicontacts` object) may have multiple levels which can be accessed through multiple dollar signs. For example `epicontacts$linelist$date_onset`]{style=\"color: darkgreen;\"}\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Access/index with brackets (`[ ]`) {.unnumbered}\n\nYou may need to view parts of objects, also called \"indexing\", which is often done using the square brackets `[ ]`. Using `$` on a dataframe to access a column is also a type of indexing.\n\n```{r}\nmy_vector <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\")  # define the vector\nmy_vector[5]                                  # print the 5th element\n```\n\nSquare brackets also work to return specific parts of an returned output, such as the output of a `summary()` function:\n\n```{r}\n# All of the summary\nsummary(linelist$age)\n\n# Just the second element of the summary, with name (using only single brackets)\nsummary(linelist$age)[2]\n\n# Just the second element, without name (using double brackets)\nsummary(linelist$age)[[2]]\n\n# Extract an element by name, without showing the name\nsummary(linelist$age)[[\"Median\"]]\n\n```\n\nBrackets also work on data frames to view specific rows and columns. You can do this using the syntax `dataframe[rows, columns]`:\n\n```{r basics_objects_access, eval=F}\n# View a specific row (2) from dataset, with all columns (don't forget the comma!)\nlinelist[2,]\n\n# View all rows, but just one column\nlinelist[, \"date_onset\"]\n\n# View values from row 2 and columns 5 through 10\nlinelist[2, 5:10] \n\n# View values from row 2 and columns 5 through 10 and 18\nlinelist[2, c(5:10, 18)] \n\n# View rows 2 through 20, and specific columns\nlinelist[2:20, c(\"date_onset\", \"outcome\", \"age\")]\n\n# View rows and columns based on criteria\n# *** Note the dataframe must still be named in the criteria!\nlinelist[linelist$age > 25 , c(\"date_onset\", \"outcome\", \"age\")]\n\n# Use View() to see the outputs in the RStudio Viewer pane (easier to read) \n# *** Note the capital \"V\" in View() function\nView(linelist[2:20, \"date_onset\"])\n\n# Save as a new object\nnew_table <- linelist[2:20, c(\"date_onset\")] \n```\n\nNote that you can also achieve the above row/column indexing on data frames and tibbles using **dplyr** syntax (functions `filter()` for rows, and `select()` for columns). Read more about these core functions in the [Cleaning data and core functions] page.\n\nTo filter based on \"row number\", you can use the **dplyr** function `row_number()` with open parentheses as part of a logical filtering statement. Often you will use the `%in%` operator and a range of numbers as part of that logical statement, as shown below. To see the *first* N rows, you can also use the special **dplyr** function `head()`.\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# View first 100 rows\nlinelist %>% head(100)\n\n# Show row 5 only\nlinelist %>% filter(row_number() == 5)\n\n# View rows 2 through 20, and three specific columns (note no quotes necessary on column names)\nlinelist %>% filter(row_number() %in% 2:20) %>% select(date_onset, outcome, age)\n```\n\nWhen indexing an object of class **list**, single brackets always return with class list, even if only a single object is returned. Double brackets, however, can be used to access a single element and return a different class than list.\\\nBrackets can also be written after one another, as demonstrated below.\n\nThis [visual explanation of lists indexing, with pepper shakers](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#lists-of-condiments) is humorous and helpful.\n\n```{r}\n# define demo list\nmy_list <- list(\n  # First element in the list is a character vector\n  hospitals = c(\"Central\", \"Empire\", \"Santa Anna\"),\n  \n  # second element in the list is a data frame of addresses\n  addresses   = data.frame(\n    street = c(\"145 Medical Way\", \"1048 Brown Ave\", \"999 El Camino\"),\n    city   = c(\"Andover\", \"Hamilton\", \"El Paso\")\n    )\n  )\n```\n\nHere is how the list looks when printed to the console. See how there are two named elements:\n\n-   `hospitals`, a character vector\\\n-   `addresses`, a data frame of addresses\n\n```{r}\nmy_list\n```\n\nNow we extract, using various methods:\n\n```{r}\nmy_list[1] # this returns the element in class \"list\" - the element name is still displayed\n\nmy_list[[1]] # this returns only the (unnamed) character vector\n\nmy_list[[\"hospitals\"]] # you can also index by name of the list element\n\nmy_list[[1]][3] # this returns the third element of the \"hospitals\" character vector\n\nmy_list[[2]][1] # This returns the first column (\"street\") of the address data frame\n\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Remove objects {.unnumbered}\n\nYou can remove individual objects from your R environment by putting the name in the `rm()` function (no quote marks):\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nrm(object_name)\n```\n\nYou can remove all objects (clear your workspace) by running:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nrm(list = ls(all = TRUE))\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Piping (`%>%`)\n\n**Two general approaches to working with objects are:**\n\n1)  **Pipes/tidyverse** - pipes send an object from function to function - emphasis is on the *action*, not the object\\\n2)  **Define intermediate objects** - an object is re-defined again and again - emphasis is on the object\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### **Pipes** {.unnumbered}\n\n**Simply explained, the pipe operator (`%>%`) passes an intermediate output from one function to the next.**\\\nYou can think of it as saying \"then\". Many functions can be linked together with `%>%`.\n\n-   **Piping emphasizes a sequence of actions, not the object the actions are being performed on**\\\n-   Pipes are best when a sequence of actions must be performed on one object\\\n-   Pipes come from the package **magrittr**, which is automatically included in packages **dplyr** and **tidyverse**\n-   Pipes can make code more clean and easier to read, more intuitive\n\nRead more on this approach in the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html)\n\nHere is a fake example for comparison, using fictional functions to \"bake a cake\". First, the pipe method:\n\n```{r piping_example_pipe, eval=F}\n# A fake example of how to bake a cake using piping syntax\n\ncake <- flour %>%       # to define cake, start with flour, and then...\n  add(eggs) %>%   # add eggs\n  add(oil) %>%    # add oil\n  add(water) %>%  # add water\n  mix_together(         # mix together\n    utensil = spoon,\n    minutes = 2) %>%    \n  bake(degrees = 350,   # bake\n       system = \"fahrenheit\",\n       minutes = 35) %>%  \n  let_cool()            # let it cool down\n```\n\nHere is another [link](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/pipes/#:~:text=Pipes%20are%20an%20extremely%20useful,code%20and%20combine%20multiple%20operations) describing the utility of pipes.\n\nPiping is not a **base** function. To use piping, the **magrittr** package must be installed and loaded (this is typically done by loading **tidyverse** or **dplyr** package which include it). You can [read more about piping in the magrittr documentation](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/).\n\nNote that just like other R commands, pipes can be used to just display the result, or to save/re-save an object, depending on whether the assignment operator `<-` is involved. See both below:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# Create or overwrite object, defining as aggregate counts by age category (not printed)\nlinelist_summary <- linelist %>% \n  count(age_cat)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Print the table of counts in the console, but don't save it\nlinelist %>% \n  count(age_cat)\n```\n\n**`%<>%`**\\\nThis is an \"assignment pipe\" from the **magrittr** package, which *pipes an object forward and also re-defines the object*. It must be the first pipe operator in the chain. It is shorthand. The below two commands are equivalent:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nlinelist <- linelist %>%\n  filter(age > 50)\n\nlinelist %<>% filter(age > 50)\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Define intermediate objects {.unnumbered}\n\nThis approach to changing objects/dataframes may be better if:\n\n-   You need to manipulate multiple objects\\\n-   There are intermediate steps that are meaningful and deserve separate object names\n\n**Risks:**\n\n-   Creating new objects for each step means creating lots of objects. If you use the wrong one you might not realize it!\\\n-   Naming all the objects can be confusing\\\n-   Errors may not be easily detectable\n\nEither name each intermediate object, or overwrite the original, or combine all the functions together. All come with their own risks.\n\nBelow is the same fake \"cake\" example as above, but using this style:\n\n```{r piping_example_redefine, eval=F}\n# a fake example of how to bake a cake using this method (defining intermediate objects)\nbatter_1 <- left_join(flour, eggs)\nbatter_2 <- left_join(batter_1, oil)\nbatter_3 <- left_join(batter_2, water)\n\nbatter_4 <- mix_together(object = batter_3, utensil = spoon, minutes = 2)\n\ncake <- bake(batter_4, degrees = 350, system = \"fahrenheit\", minutes = 35)\n\ncake <- let_cool(cake)\n```\n\nCombine all functions together - this is difficult to read:\n\n```{r eval=F}\n# an example of combining/nesting mutliple functions together - difficult to read\ncake <- let_cool(bake(mix_together(batter_3, utensil = spoon, minutes = 2), degrees = 350, system = \"fahrenheit\", minutes = 35))\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Key operators and functions {#operators}\n\nThis section details operators in R, such as:\n\n-   Definitional operators\\\n-   Relational operators (less than, equal too..)\\\n-   Logical operators (and, or...)\\\n-   Handling missing values\\\n-   Mathematical operators and functions (+/-, \\>, sum(), median(), ...)\\\n-   The `%in%` operator\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Assignment operators {.unnumbered}\n\n**`<-`**\n\nThe basic assignment operator in R is `<-`.

We advise use of `<-` for general R use.\\\nWe also advise surrounding such operators with spaces, for readability.\n\n**`<<-`**\n\nIf [Writing functions], or using R in an interactive way with sourced scripts, then you may need to use this assignment operator `<<-` (from **base** R). This operator is used to define an object in a higher 'parent' R Environment. See this [online reference](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/assignOps.html).\n\n**`%<>%`**\n\nThis is an \"assignment pipe\" from the **magrittr** package, which pipes an object forward and *also re-defines the object*. It must be the first pipe operator in the chain. It is shorthand, as shown below in two equivalent examples:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nlinelist <- linelist %>% \n  mutate(age_months = age_years * 12)\n```\n\nThe above is equivalent to the below:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\nlinelist %<>% mutate(age_months = age_years * 12)\n```\n\n**`%<+%`**\n\nThis is used to add data to phylogenetic trees with the **ggtree** package.

Whether you put spaces around the operators is not important.\n\n| Purpose             | Example in R |\n|---------------------|--------------|\n| addition            | 2 + 3        |\n| subtraction         | 2 - 3        |\n| multiplication      | 2 \\* 3       |\n| division            | 30 / 5       |\n| exponent            | 2\\^3         |\n| order of operations | ( )          |\n\n#### Mathematical functions {.unnumbered}\n\n| Purpose            | Function                              |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| rounding           | round(x, digits = n)                  |\n| rounding           | janitor::round_half_up(x, digits = n) |\n| ceiling (round up) | ceiling(x)                            |\n| floor (round down) | floor(x)                              |\n| absolute value     | abs(x)                                |\n| square root        | sqrt(x)                               |\n| exponent           | exponent(x)                           |\n| natural logarithm  | log(x)                                |\n| log base 10        | log10(x)                              |\n| log base 2         | log2(x)                               |\n\nNote: for `round()` the `digits =` specifies the number of decimal placed. Use `signif()` to round to a number of significant figures.\n\n#### Scientific notation {.unnumbered}\n\nThe likelihood of scientific notation being used depends on the value of the `scipen` option.\n\nFrom the documentation of `?options`: scipen is a penalty to be applied when deciding to print numeric values in fixed or exponential notation. Positive values bias towards fixed and negative towards scientific notation: fixed notation will be preferred unless it is more than 'scipen' digits wider.\n\nIf it is set to a low number (e.g. 0) it will be \"turned on\" always. To \"turn off\" scientific notation in your R session, set it to a very high number, for example:\n\n```{r, eval=F}\n# turn off scientific notation\noptions(scipen=999)\n```\n\n#### Rounding {.unnumbered}\n\n[***DANGER:*** `round()` uses \"banker's rounding\" which rounds up from a .5 only if the upper number is even. Use `round_half_up()` from **janitor** to consistently round halves up to the nearest whole number.

You can define a vector previously, and then reference it later. For example:\n\n```{r eval=F}\naffirmative <- c(\"1\", \"Yes\", \"YES\", \"yes\", \"y\", \"Y\", \"oui\", \"Oui\", \"Si\")\n\nlinelist <- linelist %>% \n  mutate(child_hospitaled = case_when(\n    hospitalized %in% affirmative & age < 18 ~ \"Hospitalized Child\",\n    TRUE                                      ~ \"Not\"))\n```\n\nNote: If you want to detect a partial string, perhaps using `str_detect()` from **stringr**, it will not accept a character vector like `c(\"1\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"y\")`. Instead, it must be given a *regular expression* - one condensed string with OR bars, such as \"1\\|Yes\\|yes\\|y\". For example, `str_detect(hospitalized, \"1|Yes|yes|y\")`. See the page on [Characters and strings] for more information.\n\nYou can convert a character vector to a named regular expression with this command:\n\n```{r}\naffirmative <- c(\"1\", \"Yes\", \"YES\", \"yes\", \"y\", \"Y\", \"oui\", \"Oui\", \"Si\")\naffirmative\n\n# condense to \naffirmative_str_search <- paste0(affirmative, collapse = \"|\")  # option with base R\naffirmative_str_search <- str_c(affirmative, collapse = \"|\")   # option with stringr package\n\naffirmative_str_search\n```\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n## Errors & warnings\n\nThis section explains:\n\n-   The difference between errors and warnings\\\n-   General syntax tips for writing R code\\\n-   Code assists\n\nCommon errors and warnings and troubleshooting tips can be found in the page on [Errors and help].\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Error versus Warning {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen a command is run, the R Console may show you warning or error messages in red text.\n\n-   A **warning** means that R has completed your command, but had to take additional steps or produced unusual output that you should be aware of.\n\n-   An **error** means that R was not able to complete your command.\n\nLook for clues:\n\n-   The error/warning message will often include a line number for the problem.\n\n-   If an object \"is unknown\" or \"not found\", perhaps you spelled it incorrectly, forgot to call a package with library(), or forgot to re-run your script after making changes.\n\nIf all else fails, copy the error message into Google along with some key terms - chances are that someone else has worked through this already!\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### General syntax tips {.unnumbered}\n\nA few things to remember when writing commands in R, to avoid errors and warnings:\n\n-   Always close parentheses - tip: count the number of opening \"(\" and closing parentheses \")\" for each code chunk\n-   Avoid spaces in column and object names. Use underscore ( \\_ ) or periods ( . ) instead\n-   Keep track of and remember to separate a function's arguments with commas\n-   R is case-sensitive, meaning `Variable_A` is *different* from `variable_A`\n\n<!-- ======================================================= -->\n\n### Code assists {.unnumbered}\n\nAny script (RMarkdown or otherwise) will give clues when you have made a mistake. For example, if you forgot to write a comma where it is needed, or to close a parentheses, RStudio will raise a flag on that line, on the right side of the script, to warn you.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"basics.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
