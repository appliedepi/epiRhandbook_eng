{"title":"Suggested packages","markdown":{"headingText":"Suggested packages","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nBelow is a long list of suggested packages for common epidemiological work in R. You can copy this code, run it, and all of these packages will install from CRAN and load for use in the current R session. If a package is already installed, it will be loaded for use only.  \n\nYou can modify the code with `#` symbols to exclude any packages you do not want.  \n\nOf note:  \n\n* Install the **pacman** package first before running the below code. You can do this with `install.packages(\"pacman\")`. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use in the current R session. You can also load packages that are already installed with `library()` from **base** R.  \n* In the code below, packages that are included when installing/loading another package are indicated by an indent and hash. For example how **ggplot2** is listed under **tidyverse**.  \n* If multiple packages have functions with the same name, *masking* can occur when the function from the more recently-loaded package takes precedent. Read more in the [R basics] page. Consider using the package **conflicted** to manage such conflicts.  \n* See the [R basics] section on packages for more information on **pacman** and masking.  \n\nTo see the versions of R, RStudio, and R packages used during the production of this handbook, see the page on [Editorial and technical notes].  \n\n## Packages from CRAN  \n\n```{r,
