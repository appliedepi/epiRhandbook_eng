# Editorial and technical notes { }

In this page we describe the philosophical approach, style, and specific editorial decisions made during the creation of this handbook.  


## Approach and style

The potential audience for this book is large. It will surely be used by people very new to R, and also by experienced R users looking for best practices and tips. So it must be both accessible and succinct. Therefore, our approach was to provide *just enough* text explanation that someone very new to R can apply the code and follow what the code is doing.  

A few other points:  

* This is a code reference book accompanied by relatively brief examples - *not* a thorough textbook on R or data science  
* This is a *R handbook* for use within applied epidemiology - not a manual on the methods or science of applied epidemiology  
* This is intended to be a living document - optimal R packages for a given task change often and we welcome discussion about which to emphasize in this handbook  




### R packages {.unnumbered}

**So many choices**  

One of the most challenging aspects of learning R is knowing which R package to use for a given task. It is a common occurrence to struggle through a task only later to realize - hey, there's an R package that does all that in one command line!  

In this handbook, we try to offer you at least two ways to complete each task: one tried-and-true method (probably in **base** R or **tidyverse**) and one special R package that is custom-built for that purpose. We want you to have a couple options in case you can't download a given package or it otherwise does not work for you.  

In choosing which packages to use, we prioritized R packages and approaches that have been tested and vetted by the community, minimize the number of packages used in a typical work session, that are stable (not changing very often), and that accomplish the task simply and cleanly  

This handbook generally prioritizes R packages and functions from the **tidyverse**. Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share underlying grammar and data structures. All tidyverse packages can be installed or loaded via the **tidyverse** package. Read more at the [tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/).  

When applicable, we also offer code options using **base** R - the packages and functions that come with R at installation. This is because we recognize that some of this book's audience may not have reliable internet to download extra packages.  

**Linking functions to packages explicitly**

It is often frustrating in R tutorials when a function is shown in code, but you don't know which package it is from! We try to avoid this situation.  

In the narrative text, package names are written in bold (e.g. **dplyr**) and functions are written like this: `mutate()`. We strive to be explicit about which package a function comes from, either by referencing the package in nearby text or by specifying the package explicitly in the code like this: `dplyr::mutate()`. It may look redundant, but we are doing it on purpose.  

See the page on [R basics] to learn more about packages and functions.  


### Code style {.unnumbered}

In the handbook, we frequently utilize "new lines", making our code appear "long". We do this for a few reasons:  

* We can write explanatory comments with `#` that are adjacent to each little part of the code  
* Generally, longer (vertical) code is easier to read  
* It is easier to read on a narrow screen (no sideways scrolling needed)  
* From the indentations, it can be easier to know which arguments belong to which function  

As a result, code that *could* be written like this:  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>%  # group rows by hospital
  slice_max(date, n = 1, with_ties = F) # if there's a tie (of date), take the first row
```

...is written like this:  

```{r, eval=F}
linelist %>% 
  group_by(hospital) %>% # group rows by hospital
  slice_max(
    date,                # keep row per group with maximum date value 
    n = 1,               # keep only the single highest row 
    with_ties = F)       # if there's a tie (of date), take the first row
```

R code is generally not affected by new lines or indentations. When writing code, if you initiate a new line after a comma it will apply automatic indentation patterns. 

We also use lots of spaces (e.g. `n = 1` instead of `n=1`) because it is easier to read. Be kind to the people reading your code!  



### Nomenclature {.unnumbered}  

In this handbook, we generally reference "columns" and "rows" instead of "variables" and "observations". As explained in this primer on ["tidy data"](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html), most epidemiological statistical datasets consist structurally of rows, columns, and values.  

*Variables* contain the values that measure the same underlying attribute (like age group, outcome, or date of onset). *Observations* contain all values measured on the same unit (e.g. a person, site, or lab sample). So these aspects can be more difficult to tangibly define.  

In "tidy" datasets, each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell is a single value. However some datasets you encounter will not fit this mold - a "wide" format dataset may have a variable split across several columns (see an example in the [Pivoting data] page). Likewise, observations could be split across several rows.  

Most of this handbook is about managing and transforming data, so referring to the concrete data structures of rows and columns is more relevant than the more abstract observations and variables. Exceptions occur primarily in pages on data analysis, where you will see more references to variables and observations.  



### Notes {.unnumbered} 

Here are the types of notes you may encounter in the handbook:  

<span style="color: black;">**_NOTE:_** This is a note</span>  
<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** This is a tip.</span>  
<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** This is a cautionary note.</span>  
<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** This is a warning.</span>

* Dates: switched {linelist} `guess_date()` to {parsedate} `parse_date()`
* Pivoting: slight update to `pivot_wider()` `id_cols=`  
* Survey analysis: switched `plot_age_pyramid()` to `age_pyramid()`, slight change to alluvial plot code  
* Heat plots: added `ungroup()` to `agg_weeks` chunk  
* Interactive plots: added `ungroup()` to chunk that makes `agg_weeks` so that `expand()` works as intended  
* Time series: added `data.frame()` around objects within all `trending::fit()` and `predict()` commands  
* Combinations analysis: Switch `case_when()` to `ifelse()` and added optional `across()` code for preparing the data
