# Suggested packages

Below is a long list of suggested packages for common epidemiological work in R. You can copy this code, run it, and all of these packages will install from CRAN and load for use in the current R session. If a package is already installed, it will be loaded for use only.  

You can modify the code with `#` symbols to exclude any packages you do not want.  

Of note:  

* Install the **pacman** package first before running the below code. You can do this with `install.packages("pacman")`. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use in the current R session. You can also load packages that are already installed with `library()` from **base** R.  
* In the code below, packages that are included when installing/loading another package are indicated by an indent and hash. For example how **ggplot2** is listed under **tidyverse**.  
* If multiple packages have functions with the same name, *masking* can occur when the function from the more recently-loaded package takes precedent. Read more in the [R basics](basics.qmd) page. Consider using the package **conflicted** to manage such conflicts.  
* See the [R basics](basics.qmd) section on packages for more information on **pacman** and masking.  

To see the versions of R, RStudio, and R packages used during the production of this handbook, see the page on [Editorial and technical notes](editorial_style.qmd).

## Packages from Github  


Below are commmands to install two packages directly from Github repositories.  

* The development version of **epicontacts** contains the ability to make transmission trees with an temporal x-axis  
* The **epirhandbook** package contains all the example data for this handbook and can be used to download the offline version of the handbook.  


```{r, eval=F}
# Packages to download from Github (not available on CRAN)
##########################################################

# Development version of epicontacts (for transmission chains with a time x-axis)
pacman::p_install_gh("reconhub/epicontacts@timeline")

# The package for this handbook, which includes all the example data  
pacman::p_install_gh("appliedepi/epirhandbook")
