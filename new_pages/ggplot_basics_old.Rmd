# ggplot basics {}


**ggplot2** is the most popular data visualisation R package. Its `ggplot()` function is at the core of this package, and this whole approach is colloquially known as *"ggplot"* with the resulting figures sometimes affectionately called "ggplots". The "gg" in these names reflects the "**g**rammar of **g**raphics" used to construct the figures. **ggplot2** benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that further enhance its functionality.  

The syntax is significantly different from **base** `R` plotting, and has a learning curve associated with it. Using **ggplot2** generally requires the user to format their data in a way that is highly **tidyverse** compatible, which ultimately makes using these packages together very effective.

In this page we will cover the fundamentals of plotting with **ggplot2**. See the subsequent pages for tips on how to [Plot continuous data], [Plot categorical data], and some [ggplot tips] to make your plots really look nice.  

There are several extensive **ggplot2** tutorials linked in the resources section. You can also download this [data visualization with ggplot cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) from the RStudio website. If you want inspiration for ways to creatively visualise your data, we suggest reviewing websites like the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) and [Data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html).

## Preparation {}

### Load packages {.unnumbered}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,      # includes ggplot2 and other data management tools
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file locator
  stringr         # working with characters   
)
```

### Import data {.unnumbered}  

We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/epirhandbook/Epi_R_handbook/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import your data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it accepts many file types like .xlsx, .rds, .csv - see the [Import and export] page for details).

```{r,  echo=F}
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))

```

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- rio::import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below. We will focus on the continuous variables `age`, `wt_kg` (weight in kilos), `ct_blood` (CT values), and `days_onset_hosp` (difference between onset date and hospitalisation).  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```



### General cleaning {.unnumbered}

When preparing data to plot, it is best to make the data adhere to ["tidy" data standards](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) as much as possible. How to achieve this is expanded on in the data management pages of this handbook, such as [Cleaning data and core functions]. 

Some simple ways we can prepare our data to make it better for plotting can include making the contents of the data better for display - which does not necessarily equate to better for data manipulation. For example:  

* Replace `NA` values in a character column with the character string "Unknown"  
* Consider converting column to class *factor* so their values have prescribed ordinal levels  
* Clean some columns so that their "data friendly" values with underscores etc are changed to normal text or title case (see [Characters and strings])  

Here are some examples of this in action:

```{r, }
# make display version of columns with more friendly names
linelist <- linelist %>%
  mutate(
    gender_disp = case_when(gender == "m" ~ "Male",        # m to Male 
                            gender == "f" ~ "Female",      # f to Female,
                            is.na(gender) ~ "Unknown"),    # NA to Unknown
    
    outcome_disp = replace_na(outcome, "Unknown")          # replace NA outcome with "unknown"
  )
```

### Pivoting longer {.unnumbered}

As a matter of data structure, for **ggplot2** we often also want to pivot our data into *longer* formats. Read more about this is the page on [Pivoting data].  


```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center", echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "pivoting", "pivot_longer_new.png"))
```


For example, say that we want to plot data that are in a "wide" format, such as for each case in the `linelist` and their symptoms. Below we create a mini-linelist called `symptoms_data` that contains only the `case_id` and symptoms columns.  

```{r}
symptoms_data <- linelist %>% 
  select(c(case_id, fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit))
```

Here is how the first 50 rows of this mini-linelist look - see how they are formatted "wide" with each symptom as a column: 

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(symptoms_data, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

If we wanted to plot the number of cases with specific symptoms, we are limited by the fact that each symptom is a specific column. However, we can *pivot* the symptoms columns to a longer format like this:

```{r, }
symptoms_data_long <- symptoms_data %>%    # begin with "mini" linelist called symptoms_data
  
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -case_id,                       # pivot all columns except case_id (all the symptoms columns)
    names_to = "symptom_name",             # assign name for new column that holds the symptoms
    values_to = "symptom_is_present") %>%  # assign name for new column that holds the values (yes/no)
  
  mutate(symptom_is_present = replace_na(symptom_is_present, "unknown")) # convert NA to "unknown"

```


Here are the first 50 rows. Note that case has 5 rows - one for each possible symptom. The new columns `symptom_name` and `symptom_is_present` are the result of the pivot. Note that this format may not be very useful for other operations, but is useful for plotting.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(symptoms_data_long, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```






<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Basics of ggplot {}

**"Grammar of graphics" - ggplot2**  

Plotting with **ggplot2** is based on "adding" plot layers and design elements on top of one another, with each command added to the previous ones with a plus symbol (`+`). The result is a multi-layer plot object that can be saved, modified, printed, exported, etc.  

ggplot objects can be highly complex, but the basic order of layers will usually look like this:  

1. Begin with the baseline `ggplot()` command - this "opens" the ggplot and allow subsequent functions to be added with `+`. Typically the dataset is also specified in this command  
2. Add "geom" layers - these functions visualize the data as *geometries* (*shapes*), e.g. as a bar graph, line plot, scatter plot, histogram (or a combination!). These functions all start with `geom_` as a prefix.  
3. Add design elements to the plot such as axis labels, title, fonts, sizes, color schemes, legends, or axes rotation  

A simple example of skeleton code is as follows. We will explain each component in the sections below.  

```{r, eval=F}
# plot data from my_data columns as red points
ggplot(data = my_data)+                   # use the dataset "my_data"
  geom_point(                             # add a layer of points (dots)
    mapping = aes(x = col1, y = col2),    # "map" data column to axes
    color = "red")+                       # other specification for the geom
  labs()+                                 # here you add titles, axes labels, etc.
  theme()                                 # here you adjust color, font, size etc of non-data plot elements (axes, title, etc.) 
```

 


## `ggplot()`  

The opening command of any ggplot2 plot is `ggplot()`. This command simply creates a blank canvas upon which to add layers. It "opens" the way for further layers to be added with a `+` symbol.

Typically, the command `ggplot()` includes the `data = ` argument for the plot. This sets the default dataset to be used for subsequent layers of the plot.  

This command will end with a `+` after its closing parentheses. This leaves the command "open". The ggplot will only execute/appear when the full command includes a final layer *without* a `+` at the end.  

```{r, eval=F}
# This will create plot that is a blank canvas
ggplot(data = linelist)
```


## Geoms  

A blank canvas is certainly not sufficient - we need to create geometries (shapes) from our data (e.g. bar plots, histograms, scatter plots, box plots).  

This is done by adding layers "geoms" to the initial `ggplot()` command. There are many **ggplot2** functions that create "geoms". Each of these functions begins with "geom_", so we will refer to them generically as `geom_XXXX()`. There are over 40 geoms in **ggplot2** and many others created by fans. View them at the [ggplot2 gallery](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/). Some common geoms are listed below:  

* Histograms - `geom_histogram()`  
* Bar charts - `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()` (see ["Bar plot" section](#ggplot_basics_bars))  
* Box plots - `geom_boxplot()`  
* Points (e.g. scatter plots) - `geom_point()`  
* Line graphs - `geom_line()` or `geom_path()`  
* Trend lines - `geom_smooth()`  

In one plot you can display one or multiple geoms. Each is added to previous **ggplot2** commands with a `+`, and they are plotted sequentially such that later geoms are plotted on top of previous ones.  



## Mapping data to the plot  

Most geom functions must be told *what to use* to create their shapes - so you must tell them how they should *map* (assign) *columns in your data* to components of the plot like the axes, shape colors, shape sizes, etc. For most geoms, the *essential* components that must be mapped to columns in the data are the x-axis, and (if necessary) the y-axis.  

This "mapping" occurs with the `mapping = ` argument. The mappings you provide to `mapping` must be wrapped in the `aes()` function, so you would write something like `mapping = aes(x = col1, y = col2)`, as shown below.

Below, in the `ggplot()` command the data are set as the case `linelist`. In the `mapping = aes()` argument the column `age` is mapped to the x-axis, and the column `wt_kg` is mapped to the y-axis.  

After a `+`, the plotting commands continue. A shape is created with the "geom" function `geom_point()`. This geom *inherits* the mappings from the `ggplot()` command above - it knows the axis-column assignments and proceeds to visualize those relationships as *points* on the canvas.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+
  geom_point()
```

As another example, the following commands utilize the same data, a slightly different mapping, and a different geom. The `geom_histogram()` function only requires a column mapped to the x-axis, as the counts y-axis is generated automatically.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age))+
  geom_histogram()
```


### Plot aesthetics {.unnumbered}  

In ggplot terminology a plot "aesthetic" has a specific meaning. It refers to a visual property of *plotted data*. Note that "aesthetic" here refers to the *data being plotted in geoms/shapes* - not the surrounding display such as titles, axis labels, background color, that you might associate with the word "aesthetics" in common English. In ggplot those details are called "themes" and are adjusted within a `theme()` command (see [this section](#ggplot_basics_themes)).  

Therefore, plot object *aesthetics* can be colors, sizes, transparencies, placement, etc. *of the plotted data*. Not all geoms will have the same aesthetic options, but many can be used by most geoms. Here are some examples:  

* `shape =` Display a point with `geom_point()` as a dot, star, triangle, or square...  
* `fill = ` The interior color (e.g. of a bar or boxplot)  
* `color =` The exterior line of a bar, boxplot, etc., or the point color if using `geom_point()`  
* `size = ` Size (e.g. line thickness, point size)  
* `alpha = ` Transparency (1 = opaque, 0 = invisible)  
* `binwidth = ` Width of histogram bins  
* `width = ` Width of "bar plot" columns  
* `linetype =` Line type (e.g. solid, dashed, dotted) 

These plot object aesthetics can be assigned values in two ways:  

1) Assigned a static value (e.g. `color = "blue"`) to apply across all plotted observations  
2) Assigned to a column of the data (e.g. `color = hospital`) such that display of each observation depends on its value in that column  

<!-- *These non-axis aesthetics can be assigned static values (e.g. `size = 1`) or can be mapped to a column (e.g. `size = age`).* If you want the aesthetic to be assigned a static value, the assignment is placed *outside* the `mapping = aes()`. If you want the aesthetic to be scaled/depend on the value in each row of data, the assignment is made *inside* the `mapping = aes()`.   -->

### Static value {.unnumbered}  

If you want the plot object aesthetic to be static, that is - to be the same for every observation in the data, you write its assignment within the geom but *outside* of any `mapping = aes()` statement. These assignments could look like `size = 1` or `color = "blue"`. Here are two examples:  

* In the first example, the `mapping = aes()` is in the `ggplot()` command and the axes are mapping to age and weight columns in the data. The plot aesthetics `color = `, `size = `, and `alpha = ` (transparency) are assigned to static values. For clarity, this is done in the `geom_point()` function, as you may add other geoms afterward that would take different values for their plot aesthetics.  
* In the second example, the histogram requires only the x-axis mapped to a column. The histogram `binwidth = `, `color = `, `fill = ` (internal color), and `alpha = ` are agaom set in the geom to static values.  

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
# scatterplot
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+  # set data and axes mapping
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)         # set static point aesthetics

# histogram
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age))+       # set data and axes
  geom_histogram(              # display histogram
    binwidth = 7,                # width of bins
    color = "red",               # bin line color
    fill = "blue",               # bin interior color
    alpha = 0.1)                 # bin transparency
```


### Scaled to column values {.unnumbered}  

The alternative is to scale the plot object aesthetic by the values in a column. In this approach, the display of this aesthetic will depend on that observation's value in that column of the data. If the column values are continuous, the display scale (legend) for that aesthetic will be continuous. If the column values are discrete, the legend will display each value and the plotted data will appear as distinctly "grouped" (read more in the [grouping](#ggplotgroups) section of this page).  

To achieve this, you map that plot aesthetic to a *column name* (not in quotes). This must be done *within a `mapping = aes()` function* (note: there are several places in the code you can make these mapping assignments, as discussed [below](##ggplot_basics_map_loc)).  

Two examples are below.  

* In the first example, the `color = ` aesthetic (of each point) is mapped to te column `age` - and a scale has appeared in a legend! For now just note that the scale exists - we will show how to modify it in later sections.  
* In the second example two new plot aesthetics are also mapped to columns (`color = ` and `size = `), while the plot aesthetics `shape = ` and `alpha = ` are mapped to static values outside of any `mapping = aes()` function.  

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
# scatterplot
ggplot(data = linelist,   # set data
       mapping = aes(     # map aesthetics to column values
         x = age,           # map x-axis to age            
         y = wt_kg,         # map y-axis to weight
         color = age)
       )+     # map color to age
  geom_point()         # display data as points 

# scatterplot
ggplot(data = linelist,   # set data
       mapping = aes(     # map aesthetics to column values
         x = age,           # map x-axis to age            
         y = wt_kg,         # map y-axis to weight
         color = age,       # map color to age
         size = age))+      # map size to age
  geom_point(             # display data as points
    shape = "diamond",      # points display as diamonds
    alpha = 0.3)            # point transparency at 30%


```



Note: Axes assignments are always assigned to columns in the data (not to static values), and this is always done within `mapping = aes()`.  


It becomes important to keep track of your plot layers and aesthetics when making more complex plots - for example plots with multiple geoms. In the example below, the `size = ` aesthetic is assigned twice - once for `geom_point()` and once for `geom_smooth()` - both times as a static value.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(           # map aesthetics to columns
         x = age,
         y = wt_kg,
         color = age_years)
       ) + 
  geom_point(                   # add points for each row of data
    size = 1,
    alpha = 0.5) +  
  geom_smooth(                  # add a trend line 
    method = "lm",              # with linear method
    size = 2)                   # size (width of line) of 2
```






### Where to make mapping assignments {#ggplot_basics_map_loc .unnumbered}


Aesthetic mapping within `mapping = aes()` can be written in several places in your plotting commands and can even be written more than once. This can be written in the top `ggplot()` command, and/or for each individual geom beneath. The nuances include:  

* Mapping assignments made in the top `ggplot()` command will be inherited as defaults across any geom below, like how `x = ` and `y = ` are inherited 
* Mapping assignments made within one geom apply only to that geom  

Likewise, `data = ` specified in the top `ggplot()` will apply by default to any geom below, but you could also specify data for each geom (but this is more difficult).  

Thus, each of the following commands will create the same plot:  

```{r, eval=F, warning=F, message=F}
# These commands will produce the exact same plot
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age))+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = age))

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age))
```




### Groups {#ggplotgroups .unnumbered}  

You can easily group the data and "plot by group". In fact, you have already done this!  

Assign the "grouping" column to the appropriate plot aesthetic, within a `mapping = aes()`. Above, we demonstrated this using continuous values when we assigned point `size = ` to the column `age`. However this works the same way for discrete/categorical columns.  

For example, if you want points to be displayed by gender, you would set `mapping = aes(color = gender)`. A legend automatically appears. This assignment can be made within the `mapping = aes()` in the top `ggplot()` command (and be inherited by the geom), or it could be set in a separate `mapping = aes()` within the geom. Both approaches are shown below:  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg, color = gender))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```


```{r, eval=F}
# This alternative code produces the same plot
ggplot(data = linelist,
       mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(color = gender),
    alpha = 0.5)

```


Note that depending on the geom, you will need to use different arguments to group the data. For `geom_point()` you will most likely use `color =`, `shape = ` or `size = `. Whereas for `geom_bar()` you are more likely to use `fill = `. This just depends on the geom and what plot aesthetic you want to reflect the groupings.  

For your information - the most basic way of grouping the data is by using only the `group = ` argument within `mapping = aes()`. However, this by itself will not change the colors, fill, or shapes. Nor will it create a legend. Yet the data are grouped, so statistical displays may be affected.  

To adjust the order of groups in a plot, see the [ggplot tips] page or the page on [Working with factors]. There are many examples of grouped plots in the pages on plotting continuous and categorical data.   



## Facets / Small-multiples  

Facets, or "small-multiples", are used to split one plot into a multi-panel figure, with one panel ("facet") per group of data. The same type of plot is created multiple times, each one using a sub-group of the same dataset.  

Faceting is a functionality that comes with **ggplot2**, so the legends and axes of the facet "panels" are automatically aligned. There are other packages discussed in the [ggplot tips] page that are used to combine completely different plots (**cowplot** and **patchwork**) into one figure.  

Faceting is done with one the fullowing **ggplot2** functions:

  1. `facet_wrap()` To show a different panel for each level of a *single* variable. One example of this could be showing a different epidemic curve for each hospital in a region. Facets are ordered alphabetically, unless the variable is a factor with other ordering defined.  
  + You can invoke certain options to determine the layout of the facets, e.g. `nrow = 1` or `ncol = 1` to control the number of rows or columns that the faceted plots are arranged within.  
  
  2. `facet_grid()` This is used when you want to bring a second variable into the faceting arrangement. Here each panel of a grid shows the intersection between values in *two columns*. For example, epidemic curves for each hospital-age group combination with hospitals along the top (columns) and age groups along the sides (rows).  
  + `nrow` and `ncol` are not relevant, as the subgroups are presented in a grid  

Each of these functions accept a formula syntax to specify the column(s) for faceting. Both accept up to two columns, one on each side of a tilde `~`.  
* For `facet_wrap()` most often you will write only one column preceded by a tilde `~` like `facet_wrap(~hospital)`. However you can write two columns `facet_wrap(outcome ~ hospital)` - each unique combination will display in a separate panel, but they will not be arranged in a grid. The headings will show combined terms and these won't be specific logic to the columns vs. rows.  If you are providing only one faceting variable, a period `.` is used as a placeholder on the other side of the formula - see the code examples.  

* For `facet_grid()` you can also specify one or two columns to the formula (grid `rows ~ columns`). If you only want to specify one, you can place a period `.` on the other side of the tilde like `facet_grid(. ~ hospital)` or `facet_grid(hospital ~ .)`.  

Facets can quickly contain an overwhelming amount of information - its good to ensure you don't have too many levels of each variable that you choose to facet by. Here are some quick examples with the malaria dataset (see [Download book and data]) which consists of daily case counts of malaria for facilities, by age group.  

Below we import and do some quick modifications for simplicity:  

```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
# These data are daily counts of malaria cases, by facility-day
malaria_data <- import(here("data", "malaria_facility_count_data.rds")) %>%  # import
  select(-submitted_date, -Province, -newid)                                 # remove unneeded columns

```

The first 50 rows of the malaria data are below. Note there is a column `malaria_tot`, but also columns for counts by age group (these will be used in the second, `facet_grid()` example).  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(malaria_data, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```



### `facet_wrap()` {.unnumbered}

For the moment, let's focus on the columns `malaria_tot` and `District`. Ignore the age-specific count columns for now. We will plot epidemic curves with `geom_col()`, which produces a column for each day at the specified y-axis height given in column `malaria_tot` (the data are already daily counts, so we use `geom_col()` - see [the "Bar plot" section below](#ggplot_basics_bars)).  

When we add the command `facet_wrap()`, we specify a tilde and then the column to facet on (`District` in this case). You can place another column on the left side of the tilde, - this will create one facet for each combination - but we recommend you do this with `facet_grid()` instead. In this use case, one facet is created for each unique value of `District`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# A plot with facets by district
ggplot(malaria_data, aes(x = data_date, y = malaria_tot)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, fill = "darkred") +       # plot the count data as columns
  theme_minimal()+                              # simplify the background panels
  labs(                                         # add plot labels, title, etc.
    x = "Date of report",
    y = "Malaria cases",
    title = "Malaria cases by district") +
  facet_wrap(~District)                       # the facets are created
```

### `facet_grid()` {.unnumbered}  

We can use a `facet_grid()` approach to cross two variables. Let's say we want to cross `District` and age. Well, we need to do some data transformations on the age columns to get these data into ggplot-preferred "long" format. The age groups all have their own columns - we want them in a single column called `age_group` and another called `num_cases`. See the page on [Pivoting data] for more information on this process.  

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
malaria_age <- malaria_data %>%
  select(-malaria_tot) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(starts_with("malaria_rdt_")),  # choose columns to pivot longer
    names_to = "age_group",      # column names become age group
    values_to = "num_cases"      # values to a single column (num_cases)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    age_group = str_replace(age_group, "malaria_rdt_", ""),
    age_group = forcats::fct_relevel(age_group, "5-14", after = 1))
```

Now the first 50 rows of data look like this:  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(malaria_age, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


When you pass the two variables to `facet_grid()`, easiest is to use formula notation (e.g. `x ~ y`) where x is rows and y is columns. Here is the plot, using `facet_grid()` to show the plots for each combination of the columns `age_group` and `District`.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
ggplot(malaria_age, aes(x = data_date, y = num_cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "darkred", width = 1) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(
    x = "Date of report",
    y = "Malaria cases",
    title = "Malaria cases by district and age group"
  ) +
  facet_grid(District ~ age_group)
```

### Free or fixed axes {.unnumbered}  

The axes scales displayed when faceting are by default the same (fixed) across all the facets. This is helpful for cross-comparison, but not always appropriate.  

When using `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`, we can add `scales = "free_y"` to "free" or release the y-axes of the panels to scale appropriately to their data subset. This is particularly useful if the actual counts are small for one of the subcategories and trends are otherwise hard to see. Instead of "free_y" we can also write "free_x" to do the same for the x-axis (e.g. for dates) or "free" for both axes. Note that in `facet_grid`, the y scales will be the same for facets in the same row, and the x scales will be the same for facets in the same column.

When using `facet_grid` only, we can add `space = "free_y"` or `space = "free_x"` so that the actual height or width of the facet is weighted to the values of the figure within. This only works if `scales = "free"` (y or x) is already applied. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Free y-axis
ggplot(malaria_data, aes(x = data_date, y = malaria_tot)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, fill = "darkred") +       # plot the count data as columns
  theme_minimal()+                              # simplify the background panels
  labs(                                         # add plot labels, title, etc.
    x = "Date of report",
    y = "Malaria cases",
    title = "Malaria cases by district - 'free' x and y axes") +
  facet_wrap(~District, scales = "free")        # the facets are created
```


<!-- ```{r fig.show='hold', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width=c('50%', '50%')} -->
<!-- # A) Facet hospitalsation date by hospital, free y axis -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(hospital != "Missing"), # filter removes unknown hospital -->
<!--        aes(x = date_hospitalisation ))+ -->
<!--   geom_histogram(binwidth=7) + # Bindwidth = 7 days -->
<!--   labs(title = "A) Histogram with free y axis scales")+ -->
<!--   facet_grid(hospital~., # Facet with hospital as the row  -->
<!--              scales = "free_y") # Free the y scale of each facet -->

<!-- # B) Facet hospitalisation date by hospital, free y axis and vertical spacing -->
<!-- ggplot(data = linelist %>% filter(hospital != "Missing"), # filter removes unknown hospital -->
<!--        aes(x = date_hospitalisation ))+ -->
<!--   geom_histogram(binwidth=7) + # Bindwidth = 7 days -->
<!--   labs(title = "B) Histogram with free y axis scales and spacing")+ -->
<!--   facet_grid(hospital~., # Facet with hospital as the row  -->
<!--              scales = "free_y", # Free the y scale of each facet -->
<!--              space = "free_y") # Free the vertical spacing of each facet to optimise space -->

<!-- ``` -->


## Storing plots  

### Saving plots {.unnumbered}

By default when you run a `ggplot()` command, the plot will be printed to the Plots RStudio pane. However, you can also save the plot as an object by using the assignment operator `<-` and giving it a name. Then will not print unless the object name itself is run. You can also print it by wrapping the plot name with `print()`, but this is only necessary in certain circumstances such as if the plot is created inside a *for loop* used to print multiple plots at once (see [Iteration, loops, and lists] page).  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# define plot
age_by_wt <- ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age_years, y = wt_kg, color = age_years))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)

# print
age_by_wt    
```


### Modifying saved plots {.unnumbered}  

One nice thing about **ggplot2** is that you can define a plot (as above), and then add layers to it starting with its name. You do not have to repeat all the commands that created the original plot! 

For example, to modify the plot `age_by_wt` that was defined above, to include a vertical line at age 50, we would just add a `+` and begin adding additional layers to the plot.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
age_by_wt+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50)
```


### Exporting plots {.unnumbered}   

Exporting ggplots is made easy with the `ggsave()` function from **ggplot2**. It can work in two ways, either:  

* Specify the name of the plot object, then the file path and name with extension  
  * For example: `ggsave(my_plot, here("plots", "my_plot.png"))`  
* Run the command with only a file path, to save the last plot that was printed  
  * For example: `ggsave(here("plots", "my_plot.png"))`  
  
You can export as png, pdf, jpeg, tiff, bmp, svg, or several other file types, by specifying the file extension in the file path.  

You can also specify the arguments `width = `, `height = `, and `units = ` (either "in", "cm", or "mm"). You can also specify `dpi = ` with a number for plot resolution (e.g. 300). See the function details by entering `?ggsave` or reading the [documentation online](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html). 




## Labels 

Surely you will want to add or adjust the plot's labels. These are most easily done within the `labs()` function which is added to the plot with `+` just as the geoms were.  

Within `labs()` you can provide character strings to these arguements:  

* `x = ` and `y = ` The x-axis and y-axis title (labels)  
* `title = ` The main plot title  
* `subtitle = ` The subtitle of the plot, in smaller text below the title  
* `caption = ` The caption of the plot, or bottom-right by default  

Here is a plot we made earlier, but with nicer labels:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
age_by_wt <- ggplot(
  data = linelist,   # set data
  mapping = aes(     # map aesthetics to column values
         x = age,           # map x-axis to age            
         y = wt_kg,         # map y-axis to weight
         color = age))+     # map color to age
  geom_point()+           # display data as points
  labs(
    title = "Age and weight distribution",
    subtitle = "Fictional Ebola outbreak, 2014",
    x = "Age in years",
    y = "Weight in kilos",
    color = "Age",
    caption = stringr::str_glue("Data as of {max(linelist$date_hospitalisation, na.rm=T)}"))

age_by_wt
```

Note how in the caption assignment we used `str_glue()` from the **stringr** package to implant dynamic R code within the string text. The caption will show the "Data as of: " date that reflects the maximum hospitalization date in the linelist. Read more about this in the page on [Characters and strings].  

A note on specifying the *legend* title: within `labs()`, write the plot aesthetic argument that you used to create the legend. So for the example above we assigned `color = age` to create the legend. Therefore, we provide `color = ` to `labs()` and assigned the legend title desired ("Age" with capital A). If you create the legend with `aes(fill = COLUMN)`, then in `labs()` you would write `fill = ` to adjust the title of that legend. See the section on legends in the [ggplot tips] page for more details on editing legends.  



## Themes {#ggplot_basics_themes} 

One of the best parts of **ggplot2** is the amount of control you have over the plot - you can define anything! As mentioned above, the design of the plot that is *not* related to the data shapes/geometries are adjusted within the `theme()` function. For example, the plot background color, presence/absence of gridlines, and the font/size/color/alignment of text (titles, subtitles, captions, axis text...). These adjustments can be done in one of two ways:  

* Add a [*complete theme*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) `theme_()` function to make sweeping adjustments - these include `theme_classic()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()` `theme_grey()`, `theme_bw()` among others  
* Adjust each tiny aspect of the plot individually within `theme()`  


### Complete themes {.unnumbered}  

As they are quite straight-forward, we will demonstrate the complete theme functions below and will not describe them further here. Note that any micro-adjustments with `theme()` should be make *after* use of a complete theme.  

Write them with empty parentheses.  

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}

ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+  
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Theme classic")+
  theme_classic()

ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+  
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Theme bw")+
  theme_bw()

ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+  
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Theme minimal")+
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+  
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.2)+
  labs(title = "Theme gray")+
  theme_gray()
  


```

### Modify theme {.unnumbered}  

The `theme()` function can take a large number of arguments, each of which edits a very specific aspect of the plot. There is no way we could cover all of the arguments, but we will describe the general pattern for them and show you how to find the argument name that you need. The basic syntax is this:

1. Within `theme()` write the argument name for the plot element you want to edit, like `plot.title = `  
3. Provide an `element_()` function to the arguemnt  
  + Most often use `element_text()`, but others include `element_rect()` for canvas background colors, or `element_blank()` to remove plot elements  
4. Within the `element_()` function, write arguments assignments to make the fine adjustments you desire  

So, that description was quite abstract and convoluted, so here are some examples.  

The below plot looks quite silly, but it serves to show you a variety of the ways you can adjust your plot.  

* We begin with the plot `age_by_wt` defined just above and add `theme_classic()`  
* For finer adjustments we add `theme()` and include one argument for each plot element to adjust  

It can be nice to organize the arguments in logical sections. To describe just some of those used below:  

* `legend.position = ` is unique in that it accepts simple values like "bottom", "top", "left", and "right". But generally, text-related arguments require that you place the details *within* `element_text()`.  
* Title size with `element_text(size = 30)`  
* The caption horizontal alignment with `element_text(hjust = 0)` (from right to left)  
* The subtitle is italicized with `element_text(face = "italic")`  

```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
age_by_wt + 
  theme_classic()+                                 # pre-defined theme adjustments
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",                    # move legend to bottom
    
    plot.title = element_text(size = 30),          # size of title to 30
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),        # left-align caption
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"), # italicize subtitle
    
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", size = 15, angle = 90), # adjusts only x-axis text
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),         # adjusts only y-axis text
    
    axis.title = element_text(size = 20)           # adjusts both axes titles
    )     
```

Here are some especially common `theme()` arguments. You will recognize some patterns, such as appending `.x` or `.y` to apply the change only to one axis.  


`theme()` argument                 |What it adjusts
-----------------------------------|----------------------------------
`plot.title = element_text()`      |The title
`plot.subtitle = element_text()`   |The subtitle
`plot.caption = element_text()`    |The caption (family, face, color, size, angle, vjust, hjust...) 
`axis.title = element_text()`      |Axis titles (both x and y) (size, face, angle, color...)
`axis.title.x = element_text()`    |Axis title x-axis only (use `.y` for y-axis only)
`axis.text = element_text()`       |Axis text (both x and y)
`axis.text.x = element_text()`     |Axis text x-axis only (use `.y` for y-axis only)  
`axis.ticks = element_blank()`     |Remove axis ticks
`axis.line = element_line()`       |Axis lines (colour, size, linetype: solid dashed dotted etc)
`strip.text = element_text()`      |Facet strip text (colour, face, size, angle...)
`strip.background = element_rect()`|facet strip (fill, colour, size...)  

But there are so many theme arguments! How could I remember them all? Do not worry - it is impossible to remember them all. Luckily there are a few tools to help you:  

The **tidyverse** documentation on [modifying theme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html), which has a complete list.  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Run `theme_get()` from **ggplot2** to print a list of all 90+ `theme()` arguments to the console.</span>  

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** If you ever want to remove an element of a plot, you can also do it through `theme()`. Just pass `element_blank()` to an argument to have it disappear completely.</span>  


## "Bar plot" geoms {#ggplot_basics_bars}  

It can be confusing to know which geom to use to create a "bar plot". Below we attempt to clarify which to use, and when.  

### `geom_bar()` {.unnumbered}  

Use `geom_bar()` if you want bar height (or the height of stacked bar components) to reflect *the number of relevant rows in the data*. These bars will have gaps between them, unless the `width = ` plot aethetic is adjusted.  

* Provide only one axis column assignment (typically x-axis). If you provide x and y, you will get `Error: stat_count() can only have an x or y aesthetic.`  
* You can create stacked bars by adding a `fill = ` column assignment within `mapping = aes()`  
* The opposite axis will be titled "count" by default, because it represents the number of rows  

```{r}
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = hospital, fill = gender), width = 0.7)
```


### `geom_col()` {.unnumbered}  

Use `geom_col()` if you want bar height (or height of stacked bar components) to reflect pre-calculated *values* that exists in the data. Often, this is a proportion or a summary count value from "aggregated" or "count" data.  

Provide column assignments for *both* axes. Typically your x-axis column is discrete and your y-axis column is numeric. 

For purposes of demonstration, we modify the linelist into data frame that contains "aggregated counts" and proportions per hospital. If your data contain counts or proportions like below, consider using `geom_col()`. Note that you could still use `geom_bar()`, but by default it would display the number of *rows* per hospital (1).  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

proportion_died <- linelist %>%
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    n_rows = n(),
    n_died = sum(outcome == "Death", na.rm=TRUE),
    p_died = n_died / n_rows
  )

proportion_died
```

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = proportion_died)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(y = hospital, x = p_died))
```


#### Stacked `geom_col()` {.unnumbered}  

If you want stacked bars using `geom_col()`, you might need to take additional steps (often, pivoting) to ensure that the data are in "long" format (see [Pivoting data]). There should be one column containing the categories (e.g. stacks) and another column with the heights.    

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
proportion_outcome <- linelist %>%
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    
    # rows denominator per hospital
    n_rows = n(),
    
    # counts per hospital
    n_died = sum(outcome == "Death", na.rm=TRUE),
    n_alive = sum(outcome == "Recover", na.rm=TRUE),
    n_unk = sum(is.na(outcome), na.rm=TRUE),

    
    # proportions per hospital
    p_died = n_died / n_rows,
    p_alive = n_alive / n_rows,
    p_unk = n_unk / n_rows
  ) %>% 
  
  select(c(hospital, starts_with("p_"))) %>% 
  
  # pivot the proportions columns so that they are condensed to two columns (category and value)
  pivot_longer(starts_with("p_"), names_to = "proportion_cat")

proportion_outcome
```

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(data = proportion_outcome)+
  theme_minimal()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(y = hospital, x = value, fill = proportion_cat))
```



### `geom_histogram()` {.unnumbered}  

Histograms may look like bar charts, but are distinct because they measure the distribution of a continuous variable. There are no spaces between the "bars", and only one column is provided to `geom_histogram()`. There are arguments specific to histograms such as `bin_width = ` and `breaks = ` to specify how the data should be binned. The page on [Epidemic curves] provides additional detail.  

You can plot a traditional histogram with `geom_histogram()` (y-axis represents counts per bin) or the relative density with `geom_density()` (y-axis represents proportion of all rows with that value):  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}  
# raw counts per bin
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = date_onset))

# density plot
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x = date_onset))

```





## Piping into **ggplot2**   

When using pipes to clean and transform your data, it is easy to pass the transformed data into `ggplot()`.  

The pipes that pass the dataset from function-to-function will transition to `+` once the `ggplot()` function is called. Note that in this case, there is no need to specify the `data = ` argument, as this is automatically defined as the piped-in dataset.  

This is how that might look:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
linelist %>%                                                     # begin with linelist
  select(c(case_id, fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit)) %>%     # select columns
  pivot_longer(                                                  # pivot longer
    cols = -case_id,                                  
    names_to = "symptom_name",
    values_to = "symptom_is_present") %>%
  mutate(                                                        # replace missing values
    symptom_is_present = replace_na(symptom_is_present, "unknown")) %>% 
  
  ggplot(                                                        # begin ggplot!
    mapping = aes(x = symptom_name, fill = symptom_is_present))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill", col = "black") +                    
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Symptom",
    y = "Symptom status (proportion)"
  )
```
