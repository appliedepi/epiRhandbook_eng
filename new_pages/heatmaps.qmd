# Heat plots { }  


Heat plots, also known as "heat maps" or "heat tiles", can be useful visualizations when trying to display 3 variables (x-axis, y-axis, and fill). Below we demonstrate two examples:  

* A visual matrix of transmission events by age ("who infected whom")  
* Tracking reporting metrics across many facilities/jurisdictions over time  


```{r, out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "transmission_matrix.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "heat_tile.png"))

```

## Preparation { }

### Load packages {.unnumbered}  

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics](basics.qmd) for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,       # data manipulation and visualization
  rio,             # importing data 
  lubridate        # working with dates
  )
```

**Datasets**  

This page utilizes the case linelist of a simulated outbreak for the transmission matrix section, and a separate dataset of daily malaria case counts by facility for the metrics tracking section. They are loaded and cleaned in their individual sections.  







## Transmission matrix  

Heat tiles can be useful to visualize matrices. One example is to display "who-infected-whom" in an outbreak. This assumes that you have information on transmission events.  

Note that the [Contact tracing] page contains another example of making a heat tile contact matrix, using a different (perhaps more simple) dataset where the ages of cases and their sources are neatly aligned in the same row of the data frame. This same data is used to make a *density* map in the [ggplot tips] page. This example below begins from a case linelist and so involves considerable data manipulation prior to achieving a plotable data frame. So there are many scenarios to chose from...  


We begin from the case linelist of a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import your data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it accepts many file types like .xlsx, .rds, .csv - see the [Import and export](importing.qmd) page for details).  


The first 50 rows of the linelist are shown below for demonstration:  


```{r, echo=F}
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```


```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```


In this linelist:  

* There is one row per case, as identified by `case_id`  
* There is a later column `infector` that contains the `case_id` of the *infector*, who is also a case in the linelist  


```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the population as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```



### Data preparation {.unnumbered}  

**Objective**: We need to achieve a "long"-style data frame that contains one row per possible age-to-age transmission route, with a numeric column containing that row's proportion of all observed transmission events in the linelist.  

This will take several data manuipulation steps to achieve:  


#### Make cases data frame {.unnumbered} 

To begin, we create a data frame of the cases, their ages, and their infectors - we call the data frame `case_ages`. The first 50 rows are displayed below.  

```{r}
case_ages <- linelist %>% 
  select(case_id, infector, age_cat) %>% 
  rename("case_age_cat" = "age_cat")
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(case_ages, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

#### Make infectors data frame {.unnumbered}  

Next, we create a data frame of the infectors - at the moment it consists of a single column. These are the infector IDs from the linelist. Not every case has a known infector, so we remove missing values. The first 50 rows are displayed below.  


```{r}
infectors <- linelist %>% 
  select(infector) %>% 
  drop_na(infector)
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(infectors, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Next, we use joins to procure the ages of the infectors. This is not simple, because in the `linelist`, the infector's ages are not listed as such. We achieve this result by joining the case `linelist` to the infectors. We begin with the infectors, and `left_join()` (add) the case `linelist` such that the `infector` id column left-side "baseline" data frame joins to the `case_id` column in the right-side `linelist` data frame.  

Thus, the data from the infector's case record in the linelist (including age) is added to the infector row. The 50 first rows are displayed below.  

```{r}
infector_ages <- infectors %>%             # begin with infectors
  left_join(                               # add the linelist data to each infector  
    linelist,
    by = c("infector" = "case_id")) %>%    # match infector to their information as a case
  select(infector, age_cat) %>%            # keep only columns of interest
  rename("infector_age_cat" = "age_cat")   # rename for clarity
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(infector_ages, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Then, we combine the cases and their ages with the infectors and their ages. Each of these data frame has the column `infector`, so it is used for the join. The first rows are displayed below:    

```{r}
ages_complete <- case_ages %>%  
  left_join(
    infector_ages,
    by = "infector") %>%        # each has the column infector
  drop_na()                     # drop rows with any missing data
```


```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(ages_complete, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Below, a simple cross-tabulation of counts between the case and infector age groups. Labels added for clarity.  

```{r}
table(cases = ages_complete$case_age_cat,
      infectors = ages_complete$infector_age_cat)
```


We can convert this table to a data frame with `data.frame()` from **base** R, which also automatically converts it to "long" format, which is desired for the `ggplot()`. The first rows are shown below.  

```{r}
long_counts <- data.frame(table(
    cases     = ages_complete$case_age_cat,
    infectors = ages_complete$infector_age_cat))
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(long_counts, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```


Now we do the same, but apply `prop.table()` from **base** R to the table so instead of counts we get proportions of the total. The first 50 rows are shown below.    

```{r}
long_prop <- data.frame(prop.table(table(
    cases = ages_complete$case_age_cat,
    infectors = ages_complete$infector_age_cat)))
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the shapefile as a table
DT::datatable(head(long_prop, 50), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```




### Create heat plot {.unnumbered}  

Now finally we can create the heat plot with **ggplot2** package, using the `geom_tile()` function. See the [ggplot tips](ggplot_tips.qmd) page to learn more extensively about color/fill scales, especially the `scale_fill_gradient()` function.  

* In the aesthetics `aes()` of `geom_tile()` set the x and y as the case age and infector age  
* Also in `aes()` set the argument `fill = ` to the `Freq` column - this is the value that will be converted to a tile color  
* Set a scale color with `scale_fill_gradient()` - you can specify the high/low colors  
  * Note that `scale_color_gradient()` is different! In this case you want the fill  
* Because the color is made via "fill", you can use the `fill = ` argument in `labs()` to change the legend title  

```{r}
ggplot(data = long_prop)+       # use long data, with proportions as Freq
  geom_tile(                    # visualize it in tiles
    aes(
      x = cases,         # x-axis is case age
      y = infectors,     # y-axis is infector age
      fill = Freq))+            # color of the tile is the Freq column in the data
  scale_fill_gradient(          # adjust the fill color of the tiles
    low = "blue",
    high = "orange")+
  labs(                         # labels
    x = "Case age",
    y = "Infector age",
    title = "Who infected whom",
    subtitle = "Frequency matrix of transmission events",
    fill = "Proportion of all\ntranmsission events"     # legend title
  )
  
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Reporting metrics over time { }

Often in public health, one objective is to assess trends over time for many entities (facilities, jurisdictions, etc.). One way to visualize such trends over time is a heat plot where the x-axis is time and on the y-axis are the many entities.  



### Data preparation {.unnumbered}

We begin by importing a dataset of daily malaria reports from many facilities. The reports contain a date, province, district, and malaria counts. See the page on [Download handbook and data](data_used.qmd) for information on how to download these data. Below are the first 30 rows:  

```{r, echo=F}
facility_count_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "malaria_facility_count_data.rds")) %>% 
  select(location_name, data_date, District, malaria_tot)
```

```{r, eval=F}
facility_count_data <- import("malaria_facility_count_data.rds")
```


```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(facility_count_data,30), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```


#### Aggregate and summarize {.unnumbered}

**The objective in this example** is to transform the daily facility *total* malaria case counts (seen in previous tab) into *weekly* summary statistics of facility reporting performance - in this case *the proportion of days per week that the facility reported any data*. For this example we will show data only for **Spring District**.  

To achieve this we will do the following data management steps:  

1) Filter the data as appropriate (by place, date)  
2) Create a week column using `floor_date()` from package **lubridate**  
    + This function returns the start-date of a given date's week, using a specified start date of each week (e.g. "Mondays")  
3) The data are grouped by columns "location" and "week" to create analysis units of "facility-week"  
4) The function `summarise()` creates new columns to reflecting summary statistics per facility-week group:  
    + Number of days per week (7 - a static value)  
    + Number of reports received from the facility-week (could be more than 7!)  
    + Sum of malaria cases reported by the facility-week (just for interest)  
    + Number of *unique* days in the facility-week for which there is data reported  
    + **Percent of the 7 days per facility-week for which data was reported**  
5) The data frame is joined with `right_join()` to a comprehensive list of all possible facility-week combinations, to make the dataset complete. The matrix of all possible combinations is created by applying `expand()` to those two columns of the data frame as it is at that moment in the pipe chain (represented by `.`). Because a `right_join()` is used, all rows in the `expand()` data frame are kept, and added to `agg_weeks` if necessary. These new rows appear with `NA` (missing) summarized values.  


Below we demonstrate step-by-step:  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Create weekly summary dataset
agg_weeks <- facility_count_data %>% 
  
  # filter the data as appropriate
  filter(
    District == "Spring",
    data_date < as.Date("2020-08-01")) 
```

Now the dataset has ` nrow(agg_weeks)` rows, when it previously had ` nrow(facility_count_data)`.  

Next we create a `week` column reflecting the start date of the week for each record. This is achieved with the **lubridate** package and the function `floor_date()`, which is set to "week" and for the weeks to begin on Mondays (day 1 of the week - Sundays would be 7). The top rows are shown below.  

```{r}
agg_weeks <- agg_weeks %>% 
  # Create week column from data_date
  mutate(
    week = lubridate::floor_date(                     # create new column of weeks
      data_date,                                      # date column
      unit = "week",                                  # give start of the week
      week_start = 1))                                # weeks to start on Mondays 
```

The new week column can be seen on the far right of the data frame  

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(agg_weeks,30), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```

Now we group the data into facility-weeks and summarise them to produce statistics per facility-week. See the page on [Descriptive tables](tables_descriptive.qmd) for tips. The grouping itself doesn't change the data frame, but it impacts how the subsequent summary statistics are calculated.  

The top rows are shown below. Note how the columns have completely changed to reflect the desired summary statistics. Each row reflects one facility-week. 

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
agg_weeks <- agg_weeks %>%   

  # Group into facility-weeks
  group_by(location_name, week) %>%
  
  # Create summary statistics columns on the grouped data
  summarize(
    n_days          = 7,                                          # 7 days per week           
    n_reports       = dplyr::n(),                                 # number of reports received per week (could be >7)
    malaria_tot     = sum(malaria_tot, na.rm = T),                # total malaria cases reported
    n_days_reported = length(unique(data_date)),                  # number of unique days reporting per week
    p_days_reported = round(100*(n_days_reported / n_days))) %>%  # percent of days reporting

  ungroup(location_name, week)                                    # ungroup so expand() works in next step
```

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(agg_weeks,30), rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```

Finally, we run the command below to ensure that ALL possible facility-weeks are present in the data, even if they were missing before.  

We are using a `right_join()` on itself (the dataset is represented by ".") but having been expanded to include all possible combinations of the columns `week` and `location_name`. See documentation on the `expand()` function in the page on [Pivoting](pivoting.qmd). Before running this code the dataset contains ` nrow(agg_weeks)` rows.   

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
# Create data frame of every possible facility-week
expanded_weeks <- agg_weeks %>% 
  tidyr::expand(location_name, week)  # expand data frame to include all possible facility-week combinations
```

Here is `expanded_weeks`, with `r nrow(expanded_weeks)` rows:  

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(expanded_weeks, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```

Before running this code, `agg_weeks` contains `r nrow(agg_weeks)` rows.   

```{r}
# Use a right-join with the expanded facility-week list to fill-in the missing gaps in the data
agg_weeks <- agg_weeks %>%      
  right_join(expanded_weeks) %>%                            # Ensure every possible facility-week combination appears in the data
  mutate(p_days_reported = replace_na(p_days_reported, 0))  # convert missing values to 0                           
```

After running this code, `agg_weeks` contains ` nrow(agg_weeks)` rows.   


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Create heat plot {.unnumbered}


The `ggplot()` is made using `geom_tile()` from the **ggplot2** package:  

* Weeks on the x-axis is transformed to dates, allowing use of `scale_x_date()`  
* `location_name` on the y-axis will show all facility names  
* The `fill` is `p_days_reported`, the performance for that facility-week (numeric)  
* `scale_fill_gradient()` is used on the numeric fill, specifying colors for high, low, and `NA`  
* `scale_x_date()` is used on the x-axis specifying labels every 2 weeks and their format  
* Display themes and labels can be adjusted as necessary




<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Basic {.unnumbered}  

A basic heat plot is produced below, using the default colors, scales, etc. As explained above, within the `aes()` for `geom_tile()` you must provide an x-axis column, y-axis column, **and** a column for the the `fill = `. The fill is the numeric value that presents as tile color.  

```{r}
ggplot(data = agg_weeks)+
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = week,
        y = location_name,
        fill = p_days_reported))
```

### Cleaned plot {.unnumbered}

We can make this plot look better by adding additional **ggplot2** functions, as shown below. See the page on [ggplot tips](ggplot_tips.qmd) for details.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = agg_weeks)+ 
  
  # show data as tiles
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = week,
        y = location_name,
        fill = p_days_reported),      
    color = "white")+                 # white gridlines
  
  scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "orange",
    high = "darkgreen",
    na.value = "grey80")+
  
  # date axis
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),             # remove extra space on sides
    date_breaks = "2 weeks",     # labels every 2 weeks
    date_labels = "%d\n%b")+     # format is day over month (\n in newline)
  
  # aesthetic themes
  theme_minimal()+                                  # simplify background
  
  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"),
    legend.text  = element_text(size=10, face="bold"),
    legend.key.height = grid::unit(1,"cm"),           # height of legend key
    legend.key.width  = grid::unit(0.6,"cm"),         # width of legend key
    
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),              # axis text size
    axis.text.y = element_text(vjust=0.2),            # axis text alignment
    axis.ticks = element_line(size=0.4),               
    axis.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"),  # axis title size and bold
    
    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0,size=14,face="bold"),  # title right-aligned, large, bold
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic")  # caption right-aligned and italic
    )+
  
  # plot labels
  labs(x = "Week",
       y = "Facility name",
       fill = "Reporting\nperformance (%)",           # legend title, because legend shows fill
       title = "Percent of days per week that facility reported data",
       subtitle = "District health facilities, May-July 2020",
       caption = "7-day weeks beginning on Mondays.")
```





<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Ordered y-axis {.unnumbered}  

Currently, the facilities are ordered "alpha-numerically" from the bottom to the top. If you want to adjust the order the y-axis facilities, convert them to class factor and provide the order. See the page on [Factors](factors.qmd) for tips.  

Since there are many facilities and we don't want to write them all out, we will try another approach - ordering the facilities in a data frame and using the resulting column of names as the factor level order. Below, the column `location_name` is converted to a factor, and the order of its levels is set based on the total number of reporting days filed by the facility across the whole time-span.  

To do this, we create a data frame which represents the total number of reports per facility, arranged in ascending order. We can use this vector to order the factor levels in the plot.   

```{r}
facility_order <- agg_weeks %>% 
  group_by(location_name) %>% 
  summarize(tot_reports = sum(n_days_reported, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(tot_reports) # ascending order
```

See the data frame below:  

```{r, echo=F}
DT::datatable(facility_order, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```




Now use a column from the above data frame (`facility_order$location_name`) to be the order of the factor levels of `location_name` in the data frame `agg_weeks`:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# load package 
pacman::p_load(forcats)

# create factor and define levels manually
agg_weeks <- agg_weeks %>% 
  mutate(location_name = fct_relevel(
    location_name, facility_order$location_name)
    )
```

And now the data are re-plotted, with location_name being an ordered factor:  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = agg_weeks)+ 
  
  # show data as tiles
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = week,
        y = location_name,
        fill = p_days_reported),      
    color = "white")+                 # white gridlines
  
  scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "orange",
    high = "darkgreen",
    na.value = "grey80")+
  
  # date axis
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),             # remove extra space on sides
    date_breaks = "2 weeks",     # labels every 2 weeks
    date_labels = "%d\n%b")+     # format is day over month (\n in newline)
  
  # aesthetic themes
  theme_minimal()+                                  # simplify background
  
  theme(
    legend.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"),
    legend.text  = element_text(size=10, face="bold"),
    legend.key.height = grid::unit(1,"cm"),           # height of legend key
    legend.key.width  = grid::unit(0.6,"cm"),         # width of legend key
    
    axis.text.x = element_text(size=12),              # axis text size
    axis.text.y = element_text(vjust=0.2),            # axis text alignment
    axis.ticks = element_line(size=0.4),               
    axis.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold"),  # axis title size and bold
    
    plot.title = element_text(hjust=0,size=14,face="bold"),  # title right-aligned, large, bold
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face = "italic")  # caption right-aligned and italic
    )+
  
  # plot labels
  labs(x = "Week",
       y = "Facility name",
       fill = "Reporting\nperformance (%)",           # legend title, because legend shows fill
       title = "Percent of days per week that facility reported data",
       subtitle = "District health facilities, May-July 2020",
       caption = "7-day weeks beginning on Mondays.")
```





<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Display values {.unnumbered}  


You can add a `geom_text()` layer on top of the tiles, to display the actual numbers of each tile. Be aware this may not look pretty if you have many small tiles!  

The following code has been added: `geom_text(aes(label = p_days_reported))`. This adds text onto every tile. The text displayed is the value assigned to the argument `label = `, which in this case has been set to the same numeric column `p_days_reported` that is also used to create the color gradient.  



  
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = agg_weeks)+ 
  
  # show data as tiles
  geom_tile(
    aes(x = week,
        y = location_name,
        fill = p_days_reported),      
    color = "white")+                 # white gridlines
  
  # text
  geom_text(
    aes(
