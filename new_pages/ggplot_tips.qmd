In this page we will cover tips and tricks to make your ggplots sharp and fancy. See the page on [ggplot basics](ggplot_basics.qmd) for the fundamentals.  

There a several extensive [**ggplot2** tutorials](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) linked in the Resources section. You can also download this [data visualization with ggplot cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) from the RStudio website. We strongly recommend that you peruse for inspiration at the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) and [Data-to-viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html).

## Preparation {}

### Load packages {.unnumbered}

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics](basics.qmd) for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,      # includes ggplot2 and other
  rio,            # import/export
  here,           # file locator
  stringr,        # working with characters   
  scales,         # transform numbers
  ggrepel,        # smartly-placed labels
  gghighlight,    # highlight one part of plot
  RColorBrewer    # color scales
)
```

### Import data {.unnumbered}  

For this page, we import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export](importing.qmd) page for details).  

```{r,  echo=F}
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))

```

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- rio::import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Scales for color, fill, axes, etc. {#ggplot_tips_colors}

In **ggplot2**, when aesthetics of plotted data (e.g. size, color, shape, fill, plot axis) are mapped to columns in the data, the exact display can be adjusted with the corresponding "scale" command. In this section we explain some common scale adjustments.  



### Color schemes

One thing that can initially be difficult to understand with **ggplot2** is control of color schemes. Note that this section discusses the color of *plot objects* (geoms/shapes) such as points, bars, lines, tiles, etc. To adjust color of accessory text, titles, or background color see the [Themes](ggplot_basics.qmd#ggplot_basics_themes) section of the [ggplot basics] page. 

To control "color" of *plot objects* you will be adjusting either the `color = ` aesthetic (the *exterior* color) or the `fill = ` aesthetic (the *interior* color). One exception to this pattern is `geom_point()`, where you really only get to control `color = `, which controls the color of the point (interior and exterior).  

When setting colour or fill you can use colour names recognized by R like `"red"` (see [complete list](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour) or enter `?colors`), or a specific hex colour such as `"#ff0505"`.

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# histogram - 
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age))+       # set data and axes
  geom_histogram(              # display histogram
    binwidth = 7,                # width of bins
    color = "red",               # bin line color
    fill = "lightblue")          # bin interior color (fill) 
```



As explained the [ggplot basics](ggplot_basics.qmd) section on [mapping data to the plot](ggplot_basics.qmd#ggplot_basics_mapping), aesthetics such as `fill = ` and `color = ` can be defined either *outside* of a `mapping = aes()` statement or *inside* of one. If *outside* the `aes()`, the assigned value should be static (e.g. `color = "blue"`) and will apply for *all* data plotted by the geom. If *inside*, the aesthetic should be mapped to a column, like `color = hospital`, and the expression will vary by the value for that row in the data. A few examples:  

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
# Static color for points and for line
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+     
  geom_point(color = "purple")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color = "orange")+
  labs(title = "Static color for points and line")

# Color mapped to continuous column
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+     
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = temp))+         
  labs(title = "Color mapped to continuous column")

# Color mapped to discrete column
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = age, y = wt_kg))+     
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = gender))+         
  labs(title = "Color mapped to discrete column")

# bar plot, fill to discrete column, color to static value
ggplot(data = linelist, mapping = aes(x = hospital))+     
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(fill = gender), color = "yellow")+         
  labs(title = "Fill mapped to discrete column, static color")

```


### Scales {#ggplot_tips_scales .unnumbered}  

Once you map a column to a plot aesthetic (e.g. `x = `, `y = `, `fill = `, `color = `...), your plot will gain a scale/legend. See above how the scale can be continuous, discrete, date, etc. values depending on the class of the assigned column. If you have multiple aesthetics mapped to columns, your plot will have multiple scales.  

You can control the scales with the appropriate `scales_()` function. The scale functions of **ggplot()** have 3 parts that are written like this: `scale_AESTHETIC_METHOD()`.  

1) The first part, `scale_()`, is fixed.  
2) The second part, the AESTHETIC, should be the aesthetic that you want to adjust the scale for (`_fill_`, `_shape_`, `_color_`, `_size_`, `_alpha_`...) - the options here also include `_x_` and `_y_`.  
3) The third part, the METHOD, will be either `_discrete()`, `continuous()`, `_date()`, `_gradient()`, or `_manual()` depending on the class of the column and *how* you want to control it. There are others, but these are the most-often used.  

Be sure that you use the correct function for the scale! Otherwise your scale command will not appear to change anything. If you have multiple scales, you may use multiple scale functions to adjust them! For example:  

### Scale arguments {.unnumbered}  

Each kind of scale has its own arguments, though there is some overlap. Query the function like `?scale_color_discrete` in the R console to see the function argument documentation.  

For continuous scales, use `breaks = ` to provide a sequence of values with `seq()` (take `to = `, `from = `, and `by = ` as shown in the example below. Set `expand = c(0,0)` to eliminate padding space around the axes (this can be used on any `_x_` or `_y_` scale.  

For discrete scales, you can adjust the order of level appearance with `breaks = `, and how the values display with the `labels = ` argument. Provide a character vector to each of those (see example below). You can also drop `NA` easily by setting `na.translate = FALSE`.  

The nuances of date scales are covered more extensively in the [Epidemic curves](epicurves.qmd) page.  


### Manual adjustments {.unnumbered}  

One of the most useful tricks is using "manual" scaling functions to explicitly assign colors as you desire. These are functions with the syntax `scale_xxx_manual()` (e.g. `scale_colour_manual()` or `scale_fill_manual()`). Each of the below arguments are demonstrated in the code example below.  

* Assign colors to data values with the `values = ` argument  
* Specify a color for `NA` with `na.value = `  
* Change how the values are *written* in the legend with the `labels = ` argument  
* Change the legend title with `name = `  


Below, we create a bar plot and show how it appears by default, and then with three scales adjusted - the continuous y-axis scale, the discrete x-axis scale, and manual adjustment of the fill (interior bar color).  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# BASELINE - no scale adjustment
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = outcome, fill = gender))+
  labs(title = "Baseline - no scale adjustments")

# SCALES ADJUSTED
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = outcome, fill = gender), color = "black")+
  
  theme_minimal()+                   # simplify background
  
  scale_y_continuous(                # continuous scale for y-axis (counts)
    expand = c(0,0),                 # no padding
    breaks = seq(from = 0,
                 to = 3000,
                 by = 500))+
  
  scale_x_discrete(                   # discrete scale for x-axis (gender)
    expand = c(0,0),                  # no padding
    drop = FALSE,                     # show all factor levels (even if not in data)
    na.translate = FALSE,             # remove NA outcomes from plot
    labels = c("Died", "Recovered"))+ # Change display of values
    
  
  scale_fill_manual(                  # Manually specify fill (bar interior color)
    values = c("m" = "violetred",     # reference values in data to assign colors
               "f" = "aquamarine"),
    labels = c("m" = "Male",          # re-label the legend (use "=" assignment to avoid mistakes)
              "f" = "Female",
              "Missing"),
    name = "Gender",                  # title of legend
    na.value = "grey"                 # assign a color for missing values
  )+
  labs(title = "Adjustment of scales") # Adjust the title of the fill legend
```

### Continuous axes scales {.unnumbered}  

When data are mapping to the plot axes, these too can be adjusted with scales commands. A common example is adjusting the display of an axis (e.g. y-axis) that is mapped to a column with continuous data. 

We may want to adjust the breaks or display of the values in the ggplot using `scale_y_continuous()`. As noted above, use the argument `breaks = ` to provide a sequence of values that will serve as "breaks" along the scale. These are the values at which numbers will display. To this argument, you can provide a `c()` vector containing the desired break values, or you can provide a regular sequence of numbers using the **base** R function `seq()`. This `seq()` function accepts `to = `, `from = `, and `by = `.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# BASELINE - no scale adjustment
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = outcome, fill = gender))+
  labs(title = "Baseline - no scale adjustments")

# 
ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = outcome, fill = gender))+
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(
      from = 0,
      to = 3000,
      by = 100)
  )+
  labs(title = "Adjusted y-axis breaks")

```



#### Display percents {.unnumbered}  

If your original data values are proportions, you can easily display them as percents with "%" by providing `labels = scales::percent` in your scales command, as shown below.  

While an alternative would be to convert the values to character and add a "%" character to the end, this approach will cause complications because your data will no longer be continuous numeric values. 


```{r, warning=F, message=F, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# Original y-axis proportions
#############################
linelist %>%                                   # start with linelist
  group_by(hospital) %>%                       # group data by hospital
  summarise(                                   # create summary columns
    n = n(),                                     # total number of rows in group
    deaths = sum(outcome == "Death", na.rm=T),   # number of deaths in group
    prop_death = deaths/n) %>%                   # proportion deaths in group
  ggplot(                                      # begin plotting
    mapping = aes(
      x = hospital,
      y = prop_death))+ 
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Display y-axis original proportions")



# Display y-axis proportions as percents
########################################
linelist %>%         
  group_by(hospital) %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    deaths = sum(outcome == "Death", na.rm=T),
    prop_death = deaths/n) %>% 
  ggplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = hospital,
      y = prop_death))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Display y-axis as percents (%)")+
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent                    # display proportions as percents
  )

```

#### Log scale {.unnumbered}  

To transform a continuous axis to log scale, add `trans = "log2"` to the scale command. For purposes of example, we create a data frame of regions with their respective `preparedness_index` and cumulative cases values.  

```{r}
plot_data <- data.frame(
  region = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I"),
  preparedness_index = c(8.8, 7.5, 3.4, 3.6, 2.1, 7.9, 7.0, 5.6, 1.0),
  cases_cumulative = c(15, 45, 80, 20, 21, 7, 51, 30, 1442)
)

plot_data
```

The cumulative cases for region "I" are dramatically greater than all the other regions. In circumstances like this, you may elect to display the y-axis using a log scale so the reader can see differences between the regions with fewer cumulative cases.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# Original y-axis
preparedness_plot <- ggplot(data = plot_data,  
       mapping = aes(
         x = preparedness_index,
         y = cases_cumulative))+
  geom_point(size = 2)+            # points for each region 
  geom_text(
    mapping = aes(label = region),
    vjust = 1.5)+                  # add text labels
  theme_minimal()

preparedness_plot                  # print original plot


# print with y-axis transformed
preparedness_plot+                   # begin with plot saved above
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") # add transformation for y-axis
```



### Gradient scales {.unnumbered}  

Fill gradient scales can involve additional nuance. The defaults are usually quite pleasing, but you may want to adjust the values, cutoffs, etc.  

To demonstrate how to adjust a continuous color scale, we'll use a data set from the [Contact tracing](contact_tracing.qmd) page that contains the ages of cases and of their source cases.  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
case_source_relationships <- rio::import(here::here("data", "godata", "relationships_clean.rds")) %>% 
  select(source_age, target_age) 
```

Below, we produce a "raster" heat tile density plot. We won't elaborate how (see the link in paragraph above) but we will focus on how we can adjust the color scale. Read more about the `stat_density2d()` **ggplot2** function [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density_2d.html). Note how the `fill` scale is *continuous*.  

```{r, warn=F, message=F}
trans_matrix <- ggplot(
    data = case_source_relationships,
    mapping = aes(x = source_age, y = target_age))+
  stat_density2d(
    geom = "raster",
    mapping = aes(fill = after_stat(density)),
    contour = FALSE)+
  theme_minimal()
```

Now we show some variations on the fill scale: 

```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
trans_matrix
trans_matrix + scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma")
```

Now we show some examples of actually adjusting the break points of the scale:  

* `scale_fill_gradient()` accepts two colors (high/low)  
* `scale_fill_gradientn()` accepts a vector of any length of colors to `values = ` (intermediate values will be interpolated)  
* Use [`scales::rescale()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/scales/versions/0.4.1/topics/rescale) to adjust how colors are positioned along the gradient; it rescales your vector of positions to be between 0 and 1.  


```{r, out.width=c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
trans_matrix + 
  scale_fill_gradient(     # 2-sided gradient scale
    low = "aquamarine",    # low value
    high = "purple",       # high value
    na.value = "grey",     # value for NA
    name = "Density")+     # Legend title
  labs(title = "Manually specify high/low colors")

# 3+ colors to scale
trans_matrix + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(    # 3-color scale (low/mid/high)
    colors = c("blue", "yellow","red") # provide colors in vector
  )+
  labs(title = "3-color scale")

# Use of rescale() to adjust placement of colors along scale
trans_matrix + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(    # provide any number of colors
    colors = c("blue", "yellow","red", "black"),
    values = scales::rescale(c(0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.3, 0.5)) # positions for colors are rescaled between 0 and 1
    )+
  labs(title = "Colors not evenly positioned")

# use of limits to cut-off values that get fill color
trans_matrix + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(    
    colors = c("blue", "yellow","red"),
    limits = c(0, 0.0002))+
  labs(title = "Restrict value limits, resulting in grey space")

```


### Palettes {.unnumbered}  

#### Colorbrewer and Viridis {.unnumbered}
More generally, if you want predefined palettes, you can use the `scale_xxx_brewer` or `scale_xxx_viridis_y` functions.  

The 'brewer' functions can draw from [colorbrewer.org](colorbrewer.org) palettes.  

The 'viridis' functions draw from viridis (colourblind friendly!) palettes, which "provide colour maps that are perceptually uniform in both colour and black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by viewers with common forms of colour blindness." (read more [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) and [here](https://bids.github.io/colormap/)). Define if the palette is discrete, continuous, or binned by specifying this at the end of the function (e.g. discrete is `scale_xxx_viridis_d`).

It is advised that you test your plot in this [color blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/). If you have a red/green color scheme, try a "hot-cold" (red-blue) scheme instead as described [here](https://www.visualisingdata.com/2019/08/five-ways-to-design-for-red-green-colour-blindness/#:~:text=The%20pink%2Dred%20through%20to,green%20hues%20used%20by%20default.)  

Here is an example from the [ggplot basics](ggplot_basics.qmd) page, using various color schemes. 

```{r, out.width=c('50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F} 
symp_plot <- linelist %>%                                         # begin with linelist
  select(c(case_id, fever, chills, cough, aches, vomit)) %>%     # select columns
  pivot_longer(                                                  # pivot longer
    cols = -case_id,                                  
    names_to = "symptom_name",
    values_to = "symptom_is_present") %>%
  mutate(                                                        # replace missing values
    symptom_is_present = replace_na(symptom_is_present, "unknown")) %>% 
  ggplot(                                                        # begin ggplot!
    mapping = aes(x = symptom_name, fill = symptom_is_present))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill", col = "black") +                    
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(
    x = "Symptom",
    y = "Symptom status (proportion)"
  )

symp_plot  # print with default colors

#################################

               "no" = "white",
               "unknown" = "grey"),
    breaks = c("yes", "no", "unknown"), # order the factors correctly

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Change order of discrete variables {}  

Changing the order that discrete variables appear in is often difficult to understand for people who are new to `ggplot2` graphs. It's easy to understand how to do this however once you understand how `ggplot2` handles discrete variables under the hood. Generally speaking, if a discrete varaible is used, it is automatically converted to a `factor` type - which orders factors by alphabetical order by default. To handle this, you simply have to reorder the factor levels to reflect the order you would like them to appear in the chart. For more detailed information on how to reorder `factor` objects, see the factor section of the guide. 

We can look at a common example using age groups - by default the 5-9 age group will be placed in the middle of the age groups (given alphanumeric order), but we can move it behind the 0-4 age group of the chart by releveling the factors.


```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
ggplot(
  data = linelist %>% drop_na(age_cat5),                         # remove rows where age_cat5 is missing
  mapping = aes(x = fct_relevel(age_cat5, "5-9", after = 1))) +  # relevel factor

  geom_bar() +
  
  labs(x = "Age group", y = "Number of hospitalisations",
       title = "Total hospitalisations by age group") +
  
  theme_minimal()


```

#### **ggthemr** {.unnnumbered}  

Also consider using the **ggthemr** package. You can download this package from Github using the instructions [here](https://github.com/Mikata-Project/ggthemr). It offers palettes that are very aesthetically pleasing, but be aware that these typically have a maximum number of values that can be limiting if you want more than 7 or 8 colors.  






## Contour lines  

Contour plots are helpful when you have many points that might cover each other ("overplotting"). The case-source data used above are again plotted, but more simply using `stat_density2d()` and `stat_density2d_filled()` to produce discrete contour levels - like a topographical map. Read more about the statistics [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density_2d.html).  


```{r, out.width=c('50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
case_source_relationships %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = source_age, y = target_age))+
  stat_density2d()+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "stat_density2d() + geom_point()")


case_source_relationships %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = source_age, y = target_age))+
  stat_density2d_filled()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "stat_density2d_filled()")

```



## Marginal distributions  

To show the distributions on the edges of a `geom_point()` scatterplot, you can use the **ggExtra** package and its function `ggMarginal()`. Save your original ggplot as an object, then pass it to `ggMarginal()` as shown below. Here are the key arguments:  

* You must specify the `type = ` as either "histogram", "density" "boxplot", "violin", or "densigram".  
* By default, marginal plots will appear for both axes. You can set `margins = ` to "x" or "y" if you only want one.  
* Other optional arguments include `fill = ` (bar color), `color = ` (line color), `size = ` (plot size relative to margin size, so larger number makes the marginal plot smaller).  
* You can provide other axis-specific arguments to `xparams = ` and `yparams = `. For example, to have different histogram bin sizes, as shown below.  

You can have the marginal plots reflect groups (columns that have been assigned to `color = ` in your `ggplot()` mapped aesthetics). If this is the case, set the `ggMarginal()` argument `groupColour = ` or `groupFill = ` to `TRUE`, as shown below.  

Read more at [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggExtra/vignettes/ggExtra.html), in the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/277-marginal-histogram-for-ggplot2.html) or the function R documentation `?ggMarginal`.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install/load ggExtra
pacman::p_load(ggExtra)

# Basic scatter plot of weight and age
scatter_plot <- ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = wt_kg, x = age)) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of weight and age")
```

To add marginal histograms use `type = "histogram"`. You can optionally set `groupFill = TRUE` to get stacked histograms.     

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# with histograms
ggMarginal(
  scatter_plot,                     # add marginal histograms
  type = "histogram",               # specify histograms
  fill = "lightblue",               # bar fill
  xparams = list(binwidth = 10),    # other parameters for x-axis marginal
  yparams = list(binwidth = 5))     # other parameters for y-axis marginal
```

Marginal density plot with grouped/colored values:  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Scatter plot, colored by outcome
# Outcome column is assigned as color in ggplot. groupFill in ggMarginal set to TRUE
scatter_plot_color <- ggplot(data = linelist %>% drop_na(gender))+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = wt_kg, x = age, color = gender)) +
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of weight and age")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

ggMarginal(scatter_plot_color, type = "density", groupFill = TRUE)
```

Set the `size = ` arguemnt to adjust the relative size of the marginal plot. Smaller number makes a larger marginal plot. You also set `color = `. Below are is a marginal boxplot, with demonstration of the `margins = ` argument so it appears on only one axis:  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# with boxplot 
ggMarginal(
  scatter_plot,
  margins = "x",      # only show x-axis marginal plot
  type = "boxplot")   
```

## Smart Labeling {}  

In **ggplot2**, it is also possible to add text to plots. However, this comes with the notable limitation where text labels often clash with data points in a plot, making them look messy or hard to read. There is no ideal way to deal with this in the base package, but there is a **ggplot2** add-on, known as **ggrepel** that makes dealing with this very simple! 

The **ggrepel** package provides two new functions, `geom_label_repel()` and `geom_text_repel()`, which replace `geom_label()` and `geom_text()`. Simply use these functions instead of the base functions to produce neat labels. Within the function, map the aesthetics `aes()` as always, but include the argument `label = ` to which you provide a column name containing the values you want to display (e.g. patient id, or name, etc.). You can make more complex labels by combining columns and newlines (`\n`) within `str_glue()` as shown below.  

A few tips:  

* Use `min.segment.length = 0` to always draw line segments, or `min.segment.length = Inf` to never draw them  
* Use `size = ` outside of `aes()` to set text size  
* Use `force = ` to change the degree of repulsion between labels and their respective points (default is 1)  
* Include `fill = ` within `aes()` to have label colored by value  
  * A letter "a" may appear in the legend - add `guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = aes(color = NA)))+` to remove it  

See this is very in-depth [tutorial](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/articles/examples.html) for more.  

```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel)

linelist %>%                                               # start with linelist
  group_by(hospital) %>%                                   # group by hospital
  summarise(                                               # create new dataset with summary values per hospital
    n_cases = n(),                                           # number of cases per hospital
    delay_mean = round(mean(days_onset_hosp, na.rm=T),1),    # mean delay per hospital
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n_cases, y = delay_mean))+      # send data frame to ggplot
  geom_point(size = 2)+                                    # add points
  geom_label_repel(                                        # add point labels
    mapping = aes(
      label = stringr::str_glue(
        "{hospital}\n{n_cases} cases, {delay_mean} days")  # how label displays
      ), 
    size = 3,                                              # text size in labels
    min.segment.length = 0)+                               # show all line segments                
  labs(                                                    # add axes labels
    title = "Mean delay to admission, by hospital",
    x = "Number of cases",
    y = "Mean delay (days)")
```

You can label only a subset of the data points - by using standard `ggplot()` syntax to provide different `data = ` for each `geom` layer of the plot. Below, All cases are plotted, but only a few are labeled.    

```{r, warning=F, message=FALSE}

ggplot()+
  # All points in grey
  geom_point(
    data = linelist,                                   # all data provided to this layer
    mapping = aes(x = ht_cm, y = wt_kg),
    color = "grey",
    alpha = 0.5)+                                              # grey and semi-transparent
  
  # Few points in black
  geom_point(
    data = linelist %>% filter(days_onset_hosp > 15),  # filtered data provided to this layer
    mapping = aes(x = ht_cm, y = wt_kg),
    alpha = 1)+                                                # default black and not transparent
  
  # point labels for few points
  geom_label_repel(
    data = linelist %>% filter(days_onset_hosp > 15),  # filter the data for the labels
    mapping = aes(
      x = ht_cm,
      y = wt_kg,
      fill = outcome,                                          # label color by outcome
      label = stringr::str_glue("Delay: {days_onset_hosp}d")), # label created with str_glue()
    min.segment.length = 0) +                                  # show line segments for all
  
  # remove letter "a" from inside legend boxes
  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = aes(color = NA)))+
  
  # axis labels
  labs(
    title = "Cases with long delay to admission",
    y = "weight (kg)",
    x = "height(cm)")
```

## Time axes {}

Working with time axes in ggplot can seem daunting, but is made very easy with a few key functions. Remember that when working with time or date that you should ensure that the correct variables are formatted as date or datetime class - see the [Working with dates](dates.qmd) page for more information on this, or [Epidemic curves] page (ggplot section) for examples.

The single most useful set of functions for working with dates in `ggplot2` are the scale functions (`scale_x_date()`, `scale_x_datetime()`, and their cognate y-axis functions). These functions let you define how often you have axis labels, and how to format axis labels. To find out how to format dates, see the _working with dates_ section again! You can use the `date_breaks` and `date_labels` arguments to specify how dates should look:

  1. `date_breaks` allows you to specify how often axis breaks occur - you can pass a string here (e.g. `"3 months"`, or "`2 days"`)
  
  2. `date_labels` allows you to define the format dates are shown in. You can pass a date format string to these arguments (e.g. `"%b-%d-%Y"`):


```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
# make epi curve by date of onset when available
ggplot(linelist, aes(x = date_onset)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 7) +
  scale_x_date(
    # 1 break every 1 month
    date_breaks = "1 months",
    # labels should show month then date
    date_labels = "%b %d"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

```


One easy solution to efficient date labels on the x-axis is to to assign the `labels = ` argument in `scale_x_date()` to the function `label_date_short()` from the package **scales**. This function will automatically construct efficient date labels (read more [here](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/label_date.html)). An additional benefit of this function is that the labels will automatically adjust as your data expands over time, from days, to weeks, to months and years.

See a complete example in the Epicurves page section on [multi-level date labels](https://epirhandbook.com/en/epidemic-curves.html#multi-level-date-labels), but a quick example is shown below for reference:  

```{r, eval=T, warning=F}
ggplot(linelist, aes(x = date_onset)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 7) +
  scale_x_date(
    labels = scales::label_date_short()  # automatically efficient date labels
  )+
  theme_classic()

```

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Highlighting {}

Highlighting specific elements in a chart is a useful way to draw attention to a specific instance of a variable while also providing information on the dispersion of the full dataset. While this is not easily done in base **ggplot2**, there is an external package that can help to do this known as **gghighlight**. This is easy to use within the ggplot syntax.

The **gghighlight** package uses the `gghighlight()` function to achieve this effect. To use this function, supply a logical statement to the function - this can have quite flexible outcomes, but here we'll show an example of the age distribution of cases in our linelist, highlighting them by outcome.

```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
# load gghighlight
library(gghighlight)

# replace NA values with unknown in the outcome variable
linelist <- linelist %>%
  mutate(outcome = replace_na(outcome, "Unknown"))

# produce a histogram of all cases by age
ggplot(
  data = linelist,
  mapping = aes(x = age_years, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  gghighlight::gghighlight(outcome == "Death")     # highlight instances where the patient has died.

```

This also works well with faceting functions - it allows the user to produce facet plots with the background data highlighted that doesn't apply to the facet! Below we count cases by week and plot the epidemic curves by hospital (`color = ` and `facet_wrap()` set to `hospital` column).  

```{r, , warning=F, message=F}

# produce a histogram of all cases by age
linelist %>% 
  count(week = lubridate::floor_date(date_hospitalisation, "week"),
        hospital) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = n, color = hospital))+
  theme_minimal()+
  gghighlight::gghighlight() +                      # highlight instances where the patient has died
  facet_wrap(~hospital)                              # make facets by outcome

```





## Plotting multiple datasets  

Note that properly aligning axes to plot from multiple datasets in the same plot can be difficult. Consider one of the following strategies:  

* Merge the data prior to plotting, and convert to "long" format with a column reflecting the dataset  
* Use **cowplot** or a similar package to combine two plots (see below)  






<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Combine plots {}

Two packages that are very useful for combining plots are **cowplot** and **patchwork**. In this page we will mostly focus on **cowplot**, with occassional use of **patchwork**.  

Here is the online [introduction to cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html). You can read the more extensive documentation for each function online [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cowplot/versions/1.1.1). We will cover a few of the most common use cases and functions below.  

The **cowplot** package works in tandem with **ggplot2** - essentially, you use it to arrange and combine ggplots and their legends into compound figures. It can also accept **base** R graphics.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,      # data manipulation and visualisation
  cowplot,        # combine plots
  patchwork       # combine plots
)
```


While faceting (described in the [ggplot basics](ggplot_basics.qmd) page) is a convenient approach to plotting, sometimes its not possible to get the results you want from its relatively restrictive approach. Here, you may choose to combine plots by sticking them together into a larger plot. There are three well known packages that are great for this - **cowplot**, **gridExtra**, and **patchwork**. However, these packages largely do the same things, so we'll focus on **cowplot** for this section. 

### `plot_grid()` {.unnumbered}

The **cowplot** package has a fairly wide range of functions, but the easiest use of it can be achieved through the use of `plot_grid()`. This is effectively a way to arrange predefined plots in a grid formation. We can work through another example with the malaria dataset - here we can plot the total cases by district, and also show the epidemic curve over time.


```{r, , warning=F, message=F}
malaria_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "malaria_facility_count_data.rds")) 

# bar chart of total cases by district
p1 <- ggplot(malaria_data, aes(x = District, y = malaria_tot)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    x = "District",
    y = "Total number of cases",
    title = "Total malaria cases by district"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# epidemic curve over time
p2 <- ggplot(malaria_data, aes(x = data_date, y = malaria_tot)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Date of data submission",
    y =  "number of cases"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2,
                  # 1 column and two rows - stacked on top of each other
                   ncol = 1,
                   nrow = 2,
                   # top plot is 2/3 as tall as second
                   rel_heights = c(2, 3))


```




### Combine legends {.unnumbered}  

If your plots have the same legend, combining them is relatively straight-forward. Simple use the **cowplot** approach above to combine the plots, but remove the legend from one of them (de-duplicate).  

If your plots have different legends, you must use an alternative approach:  

1) Create and save your plots *without legends* using `theme(legend.position = "none")`  
2) Extract the legends from each plot using `get_legend()` as shown below - *but extract legends from the plots modified to actually show the legend*  
3) Combine the legends into a legends panel  
4) Combine the plots and legends panel  


For demonstration we show the two plots separately, and then arranged in a grid with their own legends showing (ugly and inefficient use of space):  

```{r, out.width=c('50%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}
p1 <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital, "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)" = "St. Marks")) %>% 
  count(hospital, outcome) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = hospital, y = n, fill = outcome))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 4, na.value = "grey")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Cases by outcome")


p2 <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital, "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)" = "St. Marks")) %>% 
  count(hospital, age_cat) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = hospital, y = n, fill = age_cat))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 1, na.value = "grey")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())+
  labs(title = "Cases by age")

```

Here is how the two plots look when combined using `plot_grid()` without combining their legends:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, rel_widths = c(0.3))
```

And now we show how to combine the legends. Essentially what we do is to define each plot *without* its legend (`theme(legend.position = "none"`), and then we define each plot's legend *separately*, using the `get_legend()` function from **cowplot**. When we extract the legend from the saved plot, we need to add `+` the legend back in, including specifying the placement ("right") and smaller adjustments for alignment of the legends and their titles. Then, we combine the legends together vertically, and then combine the two plots with the newly-combined legends. Voila!  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

# Define plot 1 without legend
p1 <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital, "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)" = "St. Marks")) %>% 
  count(hospital, outcome) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = hospital, y = n, fill = outcome))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 4, na.value = "grey")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "Cases by outcome")


# Define plot 2 without legend
p2 <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital, "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)" = "St. Marks")) %>% 
  count(hospital, age_cat) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = hospital, y = n, fill = age_cat))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 1, na.value = "grey")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )+
  labs(title = "Cases by age")


# extract legend from p1 (from p1 + legend)
leg_p1 <- cowplot::get_legend(p1 +
                                theme(legend.position = "right",        # extract vertical legend
                                      legend.justification = c(0,0.5))+ # so legends  align
                                labs(fill = "Outcome"))                 # title of legend
# extract legend from p2 (from p2 + legend)
leg_p2 <- cowplot::get_legend(p2 + 
                                theme(legend.position = "right",         # extract vertical legend   
                                      legend.justification = c(0,0.5))+  # so legends align
                                labs(fill = "Age Category"))             # title of legend

# create a blank plot for legend alignment
#blank_p <- patchwork::plot_spacer() + theme_void()

# create legends panel, can be one on top of the other (or use spacer commented above)
legends <- cowplot::plot_grid(leg_p1, leg_p2, nrow = 2, rel_heights = c(.3, .7))

# combine two plots and the combined legends panel
combined <- cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, legends, ncol = 3, rel_widths = c(.4, .4, .2))

combined  # print


```

This solution was learned from [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52060601/ggplot-multiple-legends-arrangement) with a minor fix to align legends from [this post](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot/issues/33).  


<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Fun note - the "cow" in **cowplot** comes from the creator's name - Claus O. Wilke.</span>  


### Inset plots {.unnumbered} 

You can inset one plot in another using **cowplot**. Here are things to be aware of:  

* Define the main plot with `theme_half_open()` from **cowplot**; it may be best to have the legend either on top or bottom  
* Define the inset plot. Best is to have a plot where you do not need a legend. You can remove plot theme elements with `element_blank()` as shown below.  
* Combine them by applying `ggdraw()` to the main plot, then adding `draw_plot()` on the inset plot and specifying the coordinates (x and y of lower left corner), height and width as proportion of the whole main plot.  


```{r, out.width=c('100%'), fig.show='hold', warning=F, message=F}

# Define main plot
main_plot <- ggplot(data = linelist)+
  geom_histogram(aes(x = date_onset, fill = hospital))+
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 1, na.value = "grey")+ 
  theme_half_open()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(title = "Epidemic curve and outcomes by hospital")


# Define inset plot
inset_plot <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(hospital = recode(hospital, "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)" = "St. Marks")) %>% 
  count(hospital, outcome) %>% 
  ggplot()+
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = hospital, y = n, fill = outcome))+
    scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = 4, na.value = "grey")+
    coord_flip()+
    theme_minimal()+
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          axis.title.y = element_blank())+
    labs(title = "Cases by outcome") 


# Combine main with inset
cowplot::ggdraw(main_plot)+
     draw_plot(inset_plot,
               x = .6, y = .55,    #x = .07, y = .65,
               width = .4, height = .4)

```


This technique is explained more in these two vignettes:

<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Dual axes {}

A secondary y-axis is often a requested addition to a `ggplot2` graph. While there is a robust debate about the validity of such graphs in the data visualization community, and they are often not recommended, your manager may still want them. Below, we present one method to achieve them: using the **cowplot** package to combine two separate plots.  

This approach involves creating two separate plots - one with a y-axis on the left, and the other with y-axis on the right. Both will use a specific `theme_cowplot()` and must have the same x-axis. Then in a third command the two plots are aligned and overlaid on top of each other. The functionalities of **cowplot**, of which this is only one, are described in depth at this [site](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/aligning_plots.html).  

To demonstrate this technique we will overlay the epidemic curve with a line of the weekly percent of patients who died. We use this example because the alignment of dates on the x-axis is more complex than say, aligning a bar chart with another plot. Some things to note:  

* The epicurve and the line are aggregated into weeks prior to plotting *and* the `date_breaks` and `date_labels` are identical - we do this so that the x-axes of the two plots are the same when they are overlaid.  
* The y-axis is moved to the right-side for plot 2 with the `position = ` argument of `scale_y_continuous()`.  
* Both plots make use of `theme_cowplot()`  

Note there is another example of this technique in the [Epidemic curves](epicurves.qmd) page - overlaying cumulative incidence on top of the epicurve.  

**Make plot 1**  
This is essentially the epicurve. We use `geom_area()` just to demonstrate its use (area under a line, by default)  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
pacman::p_load(cowplot)            # load/install cowplot

p1 <- linelist %>%                 # save plot as object
     count(
       epiweek = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset, "week")) %>% 
     ggplot()+
          geom_area(aes(x = epiweek, y = n), fill = "grey")+
          scale_x_date(
               date_breaks = "month",
               date_labels = "%b")+
     theme_cowplot()+
     labs(
       y = "Weekly cases"
     )

p1                                      # view plot 
```

**Make plot 2**  
Create the second plot showing a line of the weekly percent of cases who died.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}

p2 <- linelist %>%         # save plot as object
     group_by(
       epiweek = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset, "week")) %>% 
     summarise(
       n = n(),
       pct_death = 100*sum(outcome == "Death", na.rm=T) / n) %>% 
     ggplot(aes(x = epiweek, y = pct_death))+
          geom_line()+
          scale_x_date(
               date_breaks = "month",
               date_labels = "%b")+
          scale_y_continuous(
               position = "right")+
          theme_cowplot()+
          labs(
            x = "Epiweek of symptom onset",
            y = "Weekly percent of deaths",
            title = "Weekly case incidence and percent deaths"
          )

p2     # view plot
```

Now we align the plot using the function `align_plots()`, specifying horizontal and vertical alignment ("hv", could also be "h", "v", "none"). We specify alignment of all axes as well (top, bottom, left, and right) with "tblr". The output is of class list (2 elements).    

Then we draw the two plots together using `ggdraw()` (from **cowplot**) and referencing the two parts of the `aligned_plots` object.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
aligned_plots <- cowplot::align_plots(p1, p2, align="hv", axis="tblr")         # align the two plots and save them as list
aligned_plotted <- ggdraw(aligned_plots[[1]]) + draw_plot(aligned_plots[[2]])  # overlay them and save the visual plot
aligned_plotted                                                                # print the overlayed plots

```



<!-- ### Statistical transformation {.unnumbered}   -->
<!-- Another way to do this to have the second axis be a direct transformation of the secondary axis.  -->

<!-- Differences in axis values will be purely cosmetic - if you want to show two different variables on one graph, with different y-axis scales for each variable, this will not work without some work behind the scenes. To obtain this effect, you will have to transform one of your variables in the data, and apply the same transformation *in reverse* when specifying the axis labels. Based on this, you can either specify the transformation explicitly (e.g. variable a is around 10x as large as variable b) or calculate it in the code (e.g. what is the ratio between the maximum values of each dataset). -->


<!-- The syntax for adding a secondary axis is very straightforward! When calling a `scale_xxx_xxx()` function (e.g. `scale_y_continuous()`), use the `sec.axis` argument to call the `sec_axis()` function. The `trans` argument in this function allows you to specify the label transformation for the axis - provide this in standard tidyverse syntax.  -->

<!-- For example, if we want to show the number of positive RDTs in the malaria dataset for facility 1, showing 0-4 year olds and all cases on chart: -->


<!-- ```{r, , warning=F, message=F} -->

<!-- # take malaria data from facility 1 -->
<!-- malaria_facility_1 <- malaria_data %>% -->
<!--   filter(location_name == "Facility 1") -->

<!-- # calculate the ratio between malaria_rdt_0-4 and malaria_tot  -->

<!-- tf_ratio <- max(malaria_facility_1$malaria_tot, na.rm = T) / max(malaria_facility_1$`malaria_rdt_0-4`, na.rm = T) -->

<!-- # transform the values in the dataset -->

<!-- malaria_facility_1 <- malaria_facility_1 %>% -->
<!--   mutate(malaria_rdt_0_4_tf = `malaria_rdt_0-4` * tf_ratio) -->


<!-- # plot the graph with dual axes -->

<!-- ggplot(malaria_facility_1, aes(x = data_date)) + -->
<!--   geom_line(aes(y = malaria_tot, col = "Total cases")) + -->
<!--   geom_line(aes(y = malaria_rdt_0_4_tf, col = "Cases: 0-4 years old")) + -->
<!--   scale_y_continuous( -->
<!--     name = "Total cases", -->
<!--     sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = ~ . / tf_ratio, name = "Cases: 0-4 years old") -->
<!--   ) + -->
<!--   labs(x = "date of data collection") + -->
<!--   theme_minimal() + -->
<!--   theme(legend.title = element_blank()) -->



<!-- ``` -->

## Packages to help you  


There are some really neat R packages specifically designed to help you navigate **ggplot2**:  


### Point-and-click **ggplot2** with **equisse**  {.unnumbered}

"This addin allows you to interactively explore your data by visualizing it with the ggplot2 package. It allows you to draw bar plots, curves, scatter plots, histograms, boxplot and sf objects, then export the graph or retrieve the code to reproduce the graph."

Install and then launch the addin via the RStudio menu or with `esquisse::esquisser()`.

See the [Github page](https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse)

[Documentation](https://dreamrs.github.io/esquisse/index.html)









## Miscellaneous  


### Numeric display {.unnumbered}  

You can disable scientific notation by running this command prior to plotting.  

```{r, eval=F}
options(scipen=999)
```

Or apply `number_format()` from the **scales** package to a specific value or column, as shown below.  

Use functions from the package **scales** to easily adjust how numbers are displayed. These can be applied to columns in your data frame, but are shown on individual numbers for purpose of example.  

```{r}
scales::number(6.2e5)
scales::number(1506800.62,  accuracy = 0.1,)
scales::comma(1506800.62, accuracy = 0.01)
scales::comma(1506800.62, accuracy = 0.01,  big.mark = "." , decimal.mark = ",")
scales::percent(0.1)
scales::dollar(56)
scales::scientific(100000)
```
