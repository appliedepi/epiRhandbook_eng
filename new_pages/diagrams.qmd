This page covers code to produce:  

* Flow diagrams using **DiagrammeR** and the DOT language
* Alluvial/Sankey diagrams
* Event timelines

<!-- * DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)   -->
<!-- * GANTT charts   -->


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation { }

### Load packages {.unnumbered}  

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics](basics.qmd) for more information on R packages.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
pacman::p_load(
  DiagrammeR,     # for flow diagrams
  networkD3,      # For alluvial/Sankey diagrams
  tidyverse       # data management and visualization
  )      
```

### Import data {.unnumbered}  

Most of the content in this page does not require a dataset. However, in the Sankey diagram section, we will use the case linelist from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to follow along for this part, <a href='https://github.com/appliedepi/epirhandbook_eng/raw/master/data/case_linelists/linelist_cleaned.rds' class='download-button'>click to download the "clean" linelist</a> (as .rds file). Import data with the `import()` function from the **rio** package (it handles many file types like .xlsx, .csv, .rds - see the [Import and export](importing.qmd) page for details).  

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "case_linelists", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- import("linelist_cleaned.rds")
```

The first 50 rows of the linelist are displayed below.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Flow diagrams { }

One can use the R package **DiagrammeR** to create charts/flow charts. They can be static, or they can adjust somewhat dynamically based on changes in a dataset.  

**Tools**  

The function `grViz()` is used to create a "Graphviz" diagram. This function accepts a *character string input containing instructions* for making the diagram. Within that string, the instructions are written in a different language, called [DOT](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html) - it is quite easy to learn the basics.  

**Basic structure**  

1) Open the instructions `grViz("`
2) Specify directionality and name of the graph, and open brackets, e.g. `digraph my_flow_chart {`
3) Graph statement (layout, rank direction)
4) Nodes statements (create nodes)
5) Edges statements (gives links between nodes)
6) Close the instructions `}")`

### Simple examples {.unnumbered} 

Below are two simple examples  

A very minimal example:  

```{r out.width='50%'}
# A minimal plot
DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {
  
graph[layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

a
b
c

a -> b -> c
}")
```

An example with perhaps a bit more applied public health context:  

```{r out.width='50%'}
grViz("                           # All instructions are within a large character string
digraph surveillance_diagram {    # 'digraph' means 'directional graph', then the graph name 
  
  # graph statement
  #################
  graph [layout = dot,
         rankdir = TB,
         overlap = true,
         fontsize = 10]
  
  # nodes
  #######
  node [shape = circle,           # shape = circle
       fixedsize = true
       width = 1.3]               # width of circles
  
  Primary                         # names of nodes
  Secondary
  Tertiary

  # edges
  #######
  Primary   -> Secondary [label = ' case transfer']
  Secondary -> Tertiary [label = ' case transfer']
}
")
```

### Syntax  {.unnumbered}

**Basic syntax**  

Node names, or edge statements, can be separated with spaces, semicolons, or newlines.  

**Rank direction**  

A plot can be re-oriented to move left-to-right by adjusting the `rankdir` argument within the graph statement. The default is TB (top-to-bottom), but it can be LR (left-to-right), RL (right-to-left), or BT (bottom-to-top).  

**Node names**  

Node names can be single words, as in the simple example above. To use multi-word names or special characters (e.g. parentheses, dashes), put the node name within single quotes (' '). It may be easier to have a short node name, and assign a *label*, as shown below within brackets [ ]. If you want to have a newline within the node's name, you must do it via a label - use `\n` in the node label within single quotes, as shown below.  

**Subgroups**  
Within edge statements, subgroups can be created on either side of the edge with curly brackets ({ }). The edge then applies to all nodes in the bracket - it is a shorthand.  


**Layouts**  

* dot (set `rankdir` to either TB, LR, RL, BT, )
* neato  
* twopi  
* circo  


**Nodes - editable attributes**  

* `label` (text, in single quotes if multi-word)  
* `fillcolor` (many possible colors)  
* `fontcolor`  
* `alpha` (transparency 0-1)  
* `shape` (ellipse, oval, diamond, egg, plaintext, point, square, triangle)  
* `style`  
* `sides`  
* `peripheries`  
* `fixedsize` (h x w)  
* `height`  
* `width`  
* `distortion`  
* `penwidth` (width of shape border)  
* `x` (displacement left/right)  
* `y` (displacement up/down)  
* `fontname`  
* `fontsize`  
* `icon`  


**Edges - editable attributes**  

* `arrowsize`  
* `arrowhead` (normal, box, crow, curve, diamond, dot, inv, none, tee, vee)  
* `arrowtail`  
* `dir` (direction, )  
* `style` (dashed, ...)  
* `color`  
* `alpha`  
* `headport` (text in front of arrowhead)  
* `tailport` (text in behind arrowtail)  
* `fontname`  
* `fontsize`  
* `fontcolor`  
* `penwidth` (width of arrow)  
* `minlen` (minimum length)

**Color names**: hexadecimal values or 'X11' color names, see [here for X11 details](https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/articles/graphviz-mermaid.html#colors) 


### Complex examples  {.unnumbered}

The example below expands on the surveillance_diagram, adding complex node names, grouped edges, colors and styling

```


```{r out.width='50%', echo=F}

                                      style = dashed]
}
")
```

**Sub-graph clusters**  

To group nodes into boxed clusters, put them within the same named subgraph (`subgraph name {}`). To have each subgraph identified within a bounding box, begin the name of the subgraph with "cluster", as shown with the 4 boxes below.  

```{r, eval = F}
DiagrammeR::grViz("             # All instructions are within a large character string
digraph surveillance_diagram {  # 'digraph' means 'directional graph', then the graph name

  graph [layout = dot,
         rankdir = TB,            
         overlap = true,
         fontsize = 10]
  

  # nodes (circles)
  #################
  node [shape = circle,                  # shape = circle
       fixedsize = true
       width = 1.3]                      # width of circles
  
  subgraph cluster_passive {
    Primary   [label = 'Primary\nFacility'] 
    Secondary [label = 'Secondary\nFacility'] 
    Tertiary  [label = 'Tertiary\nFacility'] 
    SC        [label = 'Surveillance\nCoordination',
               fontcolor = darkgreen] 
  }

  subgraph cluster_CBS {
    CBS [label = 'Community-Based\nSurveillance (CBS)']
    RECOs
  }

**Node shapes**  

The example below, borrowed from [this tutorial](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/), shows applied node shapes and a shorthand for serial edge connections  

```{r out.width='75%'}
saved_plot <- DiagrammeR::grViz("digraph {

graph [layout = dot, rankdir = LR]

# define the global styles of the nodes. We can override these in box if we wish
node [shape = rectangle, style = filled, fillcolor = Linen]

data1 [label = 'Dataset 1', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
data2 [label = 'Dataset 2', shape = folder, fillcolor = Beige]
process [label =  'Process \n Data']
statistical [label = 'Statistical \n Analysis']
results [label= 'Results']

# edge definitions with the node IDs
{data1 data2}  -> process -> statistical -> results
}")

saved_plot
```


### Outputs  {.unnumbered}

How to handle and save outputs:

* Outputs will appear in RStudio’s Viewer pane, by default in the lower-right alongside Files, Plots, Packages, and Help.
* To export you can “Save as image” or “Copy to clipboard” from the Viewer. The graphic will adjust to the specified size.


### Parameterized figures {.unnumbered} 

Here is a quote from this tutorial, [Data-driven flowcharts in R using DiagrammeR](https://mikeyharper.uk/flowcharts-in-r-using-diagrammer/). 

"Parameterized figures: A great benefit of designing figures within R is that we are able to connect the figures directly with our analysis by reading R values directly into our flowcharts. For example, suppose you have created a filtering process which removes values after each stage of a process, you can have a figure show the number of values left in the dataset after each stage of your process. To do this we, you can use the @@X symbol directly within the figure, then refer to this in the footer of the plot using [X]:, where X is the a unique numeric index."  

We encourage you to review [this tutorial](https://mikeyharper.uk/flowcharts-in-r-using-diagrammer/) if parameterization is something you are interested in.  

## Alluvial/Sankey Diagrams { }

### Load packages {.unnumbered}  

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary *and* loads it for use. You can also load installed packages with  `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics](basics.qmd) for more information on R packages.  

We load the **ggalluvial** package to produce the diagram, and also **tidyverse** for the data preparation steps.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  ggalluvial,      # For alluvial/Sankey diagrams
  tidyverse       # data management and visualization
  )      
```

### Plotting from dataset {.unnumbered} 

Plotting the connections in a dataset. Below we demonstrate using this package on the case `linelist`. Here is an [online tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggalluvial/vignettes/ggalluvial.html).    

We begin by getting the case counts for each unique `gender`, `source`, `vomit` and `outcome` combination. We've removed missing values for clarity.   

```{r}
# counts by hospital and age category
links <- linelist %>% 
  select(gender, source, vomit, outcome) %>%
  count(gender, source, vomit, outcome) %>%
     drop_na()                                #It is not necessary to drop NA values, we are just doing this for display purposes
```

The dataset now look like this:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(links, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```

Now plot the Sankey diagram with `geom_alluvium()` and `geom_stratum()`. You can read more about each argument by running `?geom_alluvium` and `?geom_stratum` in the console.

In this plot we will look at `source`, `vomit` and colour our flows by `gender`.

```{r}

# plot
ggplot(data = links,
       mapping = aes(y = n,
                     axis1 = source,
                     axis2 = vomit)) +
     geom_alluvium(aes(fill = gender)) +
     geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = "black", color = "grey") +
     geom_label(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
     scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Hospital", "Age category"), expand = c(.05, .05)) +
     scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
     theme_void()


```

To add an additional axis, we can put in the argument `axis3` within `mapping = aes()`. If we would like to move the plot from horizontal to vertical, we can use the argument `coord_flip()`.

Here is an example where the `outcome` is included as well in the argument `axis3 = outcome`

```{r}

# plot
ggplot(data = links,
       mapping = aes(y = n,
                     axis1 = source,
                     axis2 = vomit,
                     axis3 = outcome)) +
     geom_alluvium(aes(fill = gender)) +
     geom_stratum(width = 1/12, fill = "black", color = "grey") +
     geom_label(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
     scale_x_discrete(limits = c("Hospital", "Age category"), expand = c(.05, .05)) +
     scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Set1") +
     theme_void() +
     coord_flip()

```

## Event timelines { }

To make a timeline showing specific events, you can use the **vistime** package.

See this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vistime/vignettes/vistime-vignette.html#ex.-2-project-planning)

```{r}
# load package
pacman::p_load(
     vistime,  # make the timeline
     plotly    # for interactive visualization
     )
```

```{r, echo=F}
# reference: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vistime/vignettes/vistime-vignette.html#ex.-2-project-planning

data <- read.csv(text="event, group, start, end, color
                       Event 1, Group A,2020-01-22,2020-01-22, #90caf9

                       Event 2, Group J,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #fc8d62
                       Event 2, Group J,2020-01-28,2020-01-28, #1565c0
")
```

Here is the events dataset we begin with:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap')
```



```{r}

p <- vistime(data)    # apply vistime

# step 1: transform into a list
pp <- plotly_build(p)

# step 2: Marker size
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "markers") pp$x$data[[i]]$marker$size <- 10
}

# step 3: text size
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "text") pp$x$data[[i]]$textfont$size <- 10
}


# step 4: text position
for(i in 1:length(pp$x$data)){
  if(pp$x$data[[i]]$mode == "text") pp$x$data[[i]]$textposition <- "right"
}

#print
pp

```

You can build a DAG manually using the **DiagammeR** package and DOT language as described above.  

Alternatively, there are packages like **ggdag** and **daggity**
