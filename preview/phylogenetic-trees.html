<p><strong>Phylogenetic trees</strong> are used to visualize and describe the relatedness and evolution of organisms based on the sequence of their genetic code.</p>
<p>They can be constructed from genetic sequences using distance-based methods (such as neighbor-joining method) or character-based methods (such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become more affordable and is becoming more widely used in public health to describe pathogens causing infectious diseases. Portable sequencing devices decrease the turn around time and hold promises to make data available for the support of outbreak investigation in real-time. NGS data can be used to identify the origin or source of an outbreak strain and its propagation, as well as determine presence of antimicrobial resistance genes. To visualize the genetic relatedness between samples a phylogenetic tree is constructed.</p>
<p>In this page we will learn how to use the <strong>ggtree</strong> package, which allows for combined visualization of phylogenetic trees with additional sample data in form of a dataframe. This will enable us to observe patterns and improve understanding of the outbreak dynamic.</p>

<h3>Import data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#import-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The data for this page can be downloaded with the instructions on the [Download handbook and data] page.</p>
<p>There are several different formats in which a phylogenetic tree can be stored (eg. Newick, NEXUS, Phylip). A common one is the Newick file format (.nwk), which is the standard for representing trees in computer-readable form. This means an entire tree can be expressed in a string format such as “((t2:0.04,t1:0.34):0.89,(t5:0.37,(t4:0.03,t3:0.67):0.9):0.59);”, listing all nodes and tips and their relationship (branch length) to each other.</p>
<p>Note: It is important to understand that the phylogenetic tree file in itself does not contain sequencing data, but is merely the result of the genetic distances between the sequences. We therefore cannot extract sequencing data from a tree file.</p>
<p>First, we use the <code>read.tree()</code> function from <strong>ape</strong> package to import a Newick phylogenetic tree file in .txt format, and store it in a list object of class “phylo”. If necessary, use the <code>here()</code> function from the <strong>here</strong> package to specify the relative file path.</p>
<p>Note: In this case the newick tree is saved as a .txt file for easier handling and downloading from Github.</p>

<p>We inspect our tree object and see it contains 299 tips (or samples) and 236 nodes.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may have a very large phylogenetic tree and you are only interested in one part of the tree. For example, if you produced a tree including historical or international samples to get a large overview of where your dataset might fit in the bigger picture. But then to look closer at your data you want to inspect only that portion of the bigger tree.</p>
<p>Since the phylogenetic tree file is just the output of sequencing data analysis, we can not manipulate the order of the nodes and branches in the file itself. These have already been determined in previous analysis from the raw NGS data. We are able though to zoom into parts, hide parts and even subset part of the tree.</p>
<div id="zoom-in" class="section level3 unnumbered">

<p>If you don’t want to “cut” your tree, but only inspect part of it more closely you can zoom in to view a specific part.</p>
<p>First, we plot the entire tree in linear format and add numeric labels to each node in the tree.</p>

<p>As mentioned before we cannot change the order of tips or nodes in the tree, as this is based on their genetic relatedness and is not subject to visual manipulation. But we can rote branches around nodes if that eases our visualization.</p>
<p>First, we plot our new subset tree 2 with node labels to choose the node we want to manipulate and store it an a ggtree plot object <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>We can then manipulate nodes by applying <strong>ggtree::rotate()</strong> or <strong>ggtree::flip()</strong>:
Note: to illustrate which nodes we are manipulating we first apply the <strong>geom_hilight()</strong> function from <strong>ggtree</strong> to highlight the samples in the nodes we are interested in and store that ggtree plot object in a new object <code>p1</code>.</p>
