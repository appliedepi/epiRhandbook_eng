<p>There exists a growing body of tools for epidemic modelling that lets us conduct
fairly complex analyses with minimal effort. This section will provide an
overview on how to use these tools to:</p>
<ul>
<li>estimate the effective reproduction number R<sub>t</sub> and related statistics
such as the doubling time</li>
<li>produce short-term projections of future incidence</li>
</ul>
<p>It is <em>not</em> intended as an overview of the methodologies and statistical methods
underlying these tools, so please refer to the Resources tab for links to some
papers covering this. Make sure you have an understanding of
the methods before using these tools; this will ensure you can accurately
interpret their results.</p>
<p>Below is an example of one of the outputs we’ll be producing in this section.</p>

<p>We will use two different methods and packages for R<sub>t</sub> estimation,

forecasting case incidence.</p>
<p>This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses.
In this handbook we emphasize <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/pacman/man/p_load.html">p_load()</a></code> from <strong>pacman</strong>, which installs the package if necessary <em>and</em> loads it for use.
You can also load installed packages with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library()</a></code> from <strong>base</strong> R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.</p>

<h3>EpiNow2 vs. EpiEstim<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#epinow2-vs.-epiestim"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The reproduction number R is a measure of the transmissibility of a disease and
is defined as the expected number of secondary cases per infected case. In a
fully susceptible population, this value represents the basic reproduction
number R<sub>0</sub>. However, as the number of susceptible individuals in a
population changes over the course of an outbreak or pandemic, and as various
response measures are implemented, the most commonly used measure of
transmissibility is the effective reproduction number R<sub>t</sub>; this is
defined as the expected number of secondary cases per infected case at a given
time <em>t</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>EpiNow2</strong> package provides the most sophisticated framework for estimating
R<sub>t</sub>. It has two key advantages over the other commonly used package,
<strong>EpiEstim</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It accounts for delays in reporting and can therefore estimate R<sub>t</sub>
even when recent data is incomplete.</li>
<li>It estimates R<sub>t</sub> on <em>dates of infection</em> rather than the dates of
onset of reporting, which means that the effect of an intervention will
be immediately reflected in a change in R<sub>t</sub>, rather than with a
delay.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it also has two key disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires knowledge of the generation time distribution (i.e. distribution
of delays between infection of a primary and secondary cases), incubation
period distribution (i.e. distribution of delays between infection and symptom
onset) and any further delay distribution relevant to your data (e.g. if you
have dates of reporting, you require the distribution of delays from symptom
onset to reporting). While this will allow more accurate estimation of
R<sub>t</sub>, <strong>EpiEstim</strong> only requires the serial interval distribution
(i.e. the distribution of delays between symptom onset of a primary and a
secondary case), which may be the only distribution available to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>EpiNow2</strong> is significantly slower than <strong>EpiEstim</strong>, anecdotally by a factor
of about 100-1000! For example, estimating R<sub>t</sub> for the sample outbreak
considered in this section takes about four hours (this was run for a large
number of iterations to ensure high accuracy and could probably be reduced if
necessary, however the points stands that the algorithm is slow in
general). This may be unfeasible if you are regularly updating your
R<sub>t</sub> estimates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which package you choose to use will therefore depend on the data, time and
computational resources available to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="epinow2" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>EpiNow2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#epinow2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<div id="estimating-delay-distributions" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Estimating delay distributions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#estimating-delay-distributions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The delay distributions required to run <strong>EpiNow2</strong> depend on the data you
have. Essentially, you need to be able to describe the delay from the date of
infection to the date of the event you want to use to estimate R<sub>t</sub>. If
you are using dates of onset, this would simply be the incubation period
distribution. If you are using dates of reporting, you require the
delay from infection to reporting. As this distribution is unlikely to be known
directly, <strong>EpiNow2</strong> lets you chain multiple delay distributions together; in
this case, the delay from infection to symptom onset (e.g. the incubation
period, which is likely known) and from symptom onset to reporting (which you
can often estimate from the data).</p>
<p>As we have the dates of onset for all our cases in the example linelist, we will
only require the incubation period distribution to link our data (e.g. dates of
symptom onset) to the date of infection. We can either estimate this distribution
from the data or use values from the literature.</p>
<p>A literature estimate of the incubation period of Ebola (taken
from <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1411100">this paper</a>) with a
mean of 9.1, standard deviation of 7.3 and maximum value of 30 would be
specified as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb345"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span>  max <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">30</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that <strong>EpiNow2</strong> requires these delay distributions to be provided on a <strong>log</strong>
scale, hence the <code>log</code> call around each value (except the <code>max</code> parameter which,
confusingly, has to be provided on a natural scale). The <code>mean_sd</code> and <code>sd_sd</code>
define the standard deviation of the mean and standard deviation estimates. As
these are not known in this case, we choose the fairly arbitrary value of 0.1.</p>
<p>In this analysis, we instead estimate the incubation period distribution
from the linelist itself using the function <code>bootstrapped_dist_fit</code>, which will
fit a lognormal distribution to the observed delays between infection and onset
in the linelist.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb346"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The other distribution we require is the generation time. As we have data on
infection times <strong>and</strong> transmission links, we can estimate this
distribution from the linelist by calculating the delay between infection times
of infector-infectee pairs. To do this, we use the handy <code>get_pairwise</code> function
from the package <strong>epicontacts</strong>, which allows us to calculate pairwise
differences of linelist properties between transmission pairs. We first create an
epicontacts object (see [Transmission chains] page for further
details):</p>

<p>We then fit the difference in infection times between transmission pairs,

<li>We can provide any number of ‘chained’ delay distributions to the <code>delays</code>
argument; we would simply insert them alongside the <code>incubation_period</code> object
within the <code>delay_opts</code> function.</li>
<li>
<code>return_output</code> ensures the output is returned within R and not just saved to
a file.</li>
<li>
<code>verbose</code> specifies that we want a readout of the progress.</li>
<li>
<code>horizon</code> indicates how many days we want to project future incidence for.</li>
<li>We pass additional options to the <code>stan</code> argument to specify how long
we want to run the inference for. Increasing <code>samples</code> and <code>chains</code> will give
you a more accurate estimate that better characterises uncertainty, however
will take longer to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the code has finished running, we can plot a summary very easily as follows. Scroll the image to see the full extent.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb351"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>We can also look at various summary statistics:</p>

<p>For further analyses and custom plotting, you can access the summarised daily
estimates via <code>$estimates$summarised</code>. We will convert this from the default
<code>data.table</code> to a <code>tibble</code> for ease of use with <strong>dplyr</strong>.</p>

<p>To run <strong>EpiEstim</strong>, we need to provide data on daily incidence and specify the
serial interval (i.e. the distribution of delays between symptom onset of
primary and secondary cases).</p>
<p>Incidence data can be provided to <strong>EpiEstim</strong> as a vector, a data frame, or an <code>incidence</code>
object from the original <strong>incidence</strong> package. You can even distinguish between imports
and locally acquired infections; see the documentation at <code>?estimate_R</code> for
further details.</p>
<p>We will create the input using <strong>incidence2</strong>. See the page on [Epidemic curves] for more examples with the <strong>incidence2</strong> package. Since there have been updates to the <strong>incidence2</strong> package that don’t completely align with <code>estimateR()</code>’s expected input, there are some minor additional steps needed. The incidence object consists of a tibble with dates and their respective case counts. We use <code><a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/complete.html">complete()</a></code> from <strong>tidyr</strong> to ensure all dates are included (even those with no cases), and then <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/rename.html">rename()</a></code> the columns to align with what is expected by <code>estimate_R()</code> in a later step.</p>

<h4>Using serial interval estimates from the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-serial-interval-estimates-from-the-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As we have data on dates of symptom onset <em>and</em> transmission links, we can
also estimate the serial interval from the linelist by calculating the delay
between onset dates of infector-infectee pairs. As we did in the <strong>EpiNow2</strong>
section, we will use the <code>get_pairwise</code> function from the <strong>epicontacts</strong>
package, which allows us to calculate pairwise differences of linelist
properties between transmission pairs. We first create an epicontacts object
(see [Transmission chains] page for further details):</p>

<p>We then fit the difference in onset dates between transmission pairs, calculated
using <code>get_pairwise</code>, to a gamma distribution. We use the handy <code>fit_disc_gamma</code>

warning that you are estimating R<sub>t</sub> too early in the outbreak for a

<p>Besides estimating R<sub>t</sub>, <strong>EpiNow2</strong> also supports forecasting of
R<sub>t</sub> and projections of case numbers by integration with the
<strong>EpiSoon</strong> package under the hood. All you need to do is specify the <code>horizon</code>
argument in your <code>epinow</code> function call, indicating how many days you want to
project into the future; see the <strong>EpiNow2</strong> section under the “Estimating
R<sub>t</sub>” for details on how to get <strong>EpiNow2</strong> up and running. In this

number R<sub>t</sub> and the serial interval. Here we will cover how to use
serial interval estimates from the literature and how to use our own estimates
from the linelist.</p>

<h4>Using serial interval estimates from the literature<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-serial-interval-estimates-from-the-literature-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p><strong>projections</strong> requires a discretised serial interval distribution of the class
<code>distcrete</code> from the package <strong>distcrete</strong>. We will use a gamma distribution
with a mean of 12.0 and and standard deviation of 5.2 defined in
<a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0196-0">this paper</a>. To
convert these values into the shape and scale parameters required for a gamma
distribution, we will use the function <code>gamma_mucv2shapescale</code> from the
<strong>epitrix</strong> package.</p>

<h4>Using serial interval estimates from the data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-serial-interval-estimates-from-the-data-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>As we have data on dates of symptom onset <em>and</em> transmission links, we can
also estimate the serial interval from the linelist by calculating the delay
between onset dates of infector-infectee pairs. As we did in the <strong>EpiNow2</strong>
section, we will use the <code>get_pairwise</code> function from the <strong>epicontacts</strong>
package, which allows us to calculate pairwise differences of linelist
properties between transmission pairs. We first create an epicontacts object
(see [Transmission chains] page for further details):</p>

<p>We then fit the difference in onset dates between transmission pairs, calculated
using <code>get_pairwise</code>, to a gamma distribution. We use the handy <code>fit_disc_gamma</code>

<p>To project future incidence, we still need to provide historical incidence in
the form of an <code>incidence</code> object, as well as a sample of plausible
R<sub>t</sub> values. We will generate these values using the R<sub>t</sub>
estimates generated by <strong>EpiEstim</strong> in the previous section (under “Estimating
R<sub>t</sub>”) and stored in the <code>epiestim_res_emp</code> object. In the code below,
we extract the mean and standard deviation estimates of R<sub>t</sub> for the
last time window of the outbreak (using the <code>tail</code> function to access the last
element in a vector), and simulate 1000 values from a gamma distribution using
<code>rgamma</code>. You can also provide your own vector of R<sub>t</sub> values that you
want to use for forward projections.</p>
