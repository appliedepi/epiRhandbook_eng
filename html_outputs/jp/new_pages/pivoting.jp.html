<p>データを管理する上で、<u>ピボットする</u>とは次の 2 つの工程のどちらかを指しています。</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><u>ピボットテーブル</u>（大きなデータテーブルを要約した統計表）を作成すること。</li>
<li>表を縦長形式から横長形式へ、またはその逆へ変換すること。</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>このページでは、後者の定義に焦点をあてます。</strong>前者はデータ解析の重要なステップであり、<a href="grouping.jp.html">データのグループ化</a> および <a href="tables_descriptive.jp.html">記述統計表の作り方</a> の章で別に取り上げています。</p>
<p>本章では、データの形式について説明します。個々の変数が 1 つの列を持ち、個々の観測値が 1 つの行を持ち、個々の値が 1 つのセルを持つという「整然データ（tidy data）」の考え方を知っておくと便利です。このトピックについて詳しくは、R for Data Science の <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">こちら</a> の章をご参照ください。</p>

<p>以下のコードを実行すると、分析に必要なパッケージが読み込まれます。このハンドブックでは、パッケージを読み込むために、<strong>pacman</strong> パッケージの <code>p_load()</code> を主に使用しています。<code>p_load()</code> は、必要に応じてパッケージをインストールし、現在の R セッションで使用するためにパッケージを読み込む関数です。また、すでにインストールされたパッケージは、R の基本パッケージである <strong>base</strong> の <code>library()</code> を使用して読み込むこともできます。R のパッケージについて詳しくは <a href="basics.jp.html">R の基礎</a> の章をご参照ください。</p>

<p>データは「横長」形式で入力・保存されることがよくあります。つまり、研究対象者の特性や回答が 1 つの行に保存されるのです。この形式は表示する上では便利かもしれませんが、一部の分析には適していません。</p>
<p>先述の準備のセクションでインポートした <code>count_data</code> のデータセットを例にとってみましょう。各行が「施設利用日」を表していることがわかります。実際の症例数（1 番右の列）は「横長」形式で格納されており、ある施設利用日のすべての年齢層の情報が 1 行に格納されています。</p>

<p>このデータセットのそれぞれの観測値は、 2020-05-16 から 2020-08-12 までのある日付の、 65 施設のうちの 1 施設におけるマラリアの症例数を指しています。これらの施設は、1 つの <code>Province</code> （North）と 4 つの<code>District</code>（Spring、Bolo、Dingo、Barnard）に位置しています。このデータセットでは、マラリアの 総症例数と、3 つの年齢層（4 歳未満、5 ～ 14 歳、15 歳以上）におけるマラリアの症例数が含まれています。</p>
<p>このような「横長」のデータは、列見出しが実際には「変数」を表しておらず、仮想的な「年齢層」の<u>値</u>を表しているため、「整然データ」の基準に従っているとは言えません。</p>
<p>この形式は、情報を表で表示したり、症例報告書からデータを入力（Excel など）する際に便利です。しかし、解析段階においては、通常、これらのデータは「整然データ」基準に沿った「縦長」形式に変換した方が扱いやすいです。特に R パッケージの <strong>ggplot2</strong> は、データが 「縦長」形式である場合に最適に機能します。</p>
<p>マラリアの<u>総</u>症例数を時系列で視覚化することは、現在のデータ形式でも難しくありません。</p>

<p>しかし、この総症例数に対する各年齢層の相対的な寄与を表示したいとしたらどうでしょうか。この場合、関心のある変数（年齢層）が単一の列としてデータセットに含まれていることを確認する必要があります。関心のある変数が単一の列であれば、<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> で図の「見栄え」を調整する <code>aes()</code> 引数で指定することができます。</p>

<p><strong>tidyr</strong> の関数 <code>pivot_longer()</code> は、データを「長く」します。<strong>tidyr</strong> は、R パッケージの <strong>tidyverse</strong> の一部です。</p>
<p><code>pivot_longer()</code> は、変換する列の範囲（<code>= cols</code> に指定）を受け取ります。したがって、データセットの一部だけを操作することが可能です。ここでは、症例数の列だけをピボットしたいので、この関数は、マラリアのデータに適しています。</p>
<p>この処理では、2 つの「新しい」列が作成されます。1 つはカテゴリ（以前の列名）で、もう 1 つは対応する値（例：症例数）で構成されます。これらの新しい列の名前は、初期値のままでも構いませんが、<code>names_to =</code> や <code>values_to =</code> を用いて独自の名前を指定することもできます。</p>
<p>それでは、<code>pivot_longer()</code> を実際に使ってみましょう。</p>

<p>新しく作成されたデータフレーム（<code>df_long</code>）は行数が増え（12,152 vs 3,038）、縦に<u>長く</u>なっていることに注目してください。元のデータセットの各行が、<code>df_long</code> では 4 行に別れ、<code>df_long</code> の長さは元のデータセットの 4 倍の長さになっています。4 行に別れた行はそれぞれ、年齢層（4 歳未満、5 ～ 14 歳、15 歳以上、総数）ごとのマラリアの症例数を表しています。</p>
<p>新しいデータセットは、長くなっただけでなく、列の数が 10 から 8 に減っています。元のデータセットでは 4 つの列（<code>malaria_</code> で始まる列）に格納されていたデータが、新しいデータセットでは 2 つの列に格納されているためです。</p>
<p>これらの 4 つの列の列名はすべて <code>malaria_</code> で始まるので、便利な “tidyselect” 関数である <code>starts_with()</code> を使用しても同じ結果を得ることができます（これらのヘルパー関数についての詳細は、<a href="cleaning.jp.html">データクリーニングと主要関数</a> の章をご参照ください）。</p>

<p>この 2 つの新しい列には <code>name</code> と <code>value</code> という初期値の列名が与えられていますが、<code>names_to</code> と <code>values_to</code> という引数を使うことで、これらを上書きして、より意味のある列名を付けることができます。そうしておくと、その列に何の変数が格納されているかを思い出すのに便利です。ここでは、<code>age_group</code> と <code>counts</code> という列名をつけてみましょう。</p>

<p>この新しいプロットと先ほど作ったプロットを比較してみてください。<u>問題点に気づきましたか？</u></p>
<p>調査データを扱うときによくある問題に遭遇しました。<code>malaria_tot</code> 列からの総症例数も含まれているため、プロットの各棒の大きさは、実際の大きさの 2 倍になっています。</p>

<p>上記の例は、「縦長変換する」列がすべて同じデータ型（文字型、数字型、ロジカル型など）である場合にうまく機能します。</p>
<p>しかし、疫学者や疫学業務担当者が扱う仕事の領域では、非専門家によって作成され、独特で標準的ではない論理に従ったデータを扱う場合が多くあります。Hadley Wickham は、<strong>Tidy Data</strong> の原則に関する彼の<a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">重要な論文</a>で（Tolstoy の一文を参照して）次のように指摘しています。「整然データセットは家族のように、どれも似ているが、乱雑なデータセットは乱雑のあり方がそれぞれ異なっている。」</p>
<p>特によくある問題は、異なるデータ型のデータを含む列をピボットする必要があることです。このピボットでは、これらの異なるデータ型を 1 つの列に格納することになりますが、これは好ましい状況ではありません。このような混乱を回避するためには様々なアプローチがありますが、<code>pivot_longer()</code> を使用して、自分でこのような状況を作らないようにするための重要なステップがあります。</p>
<p>3 つの項目 A 、B、C のそれぞれについて、異なる時点で時系列による観測が行われた状況を考えてみましょう。例えば、個人（エボラ出血熱患者の接触者を 21 日間毎日追跡する）や、遠隔地の村の保健所がまだ機能しているかどうか年に 1 回確認することなどが挙げられます。接触者追跡の例を使ってみましょう。データが以下のように保存されているとします。</p>

</div>
<p>見ての通り、少し複雑なデータになっています。各行には 1 つの項目に関する情報が格納されていますが、時間が進むにつれて時系列がどんどん右に流れています。さらに、列のデータ型は日付型と文字型が交互になっています。</p>
<p>筆者が遭遇した特にひどい例は、コレラの調査データで、<strong>4 年間</strong><u>毎日</u> 8 列の新しい観測値が追加されたものでした。筆者のノートパソコンでは、このデータが保存されている Excel ファイルを開くだけで 10 分以上かかりました！</p>
<p>このデータを扱うには、データフレームを縦長形式に変換する必要がありますが、各項目の観測ごとに、日付型の列（<code>date</code> 列）と文字型の列（<code>character</code> 列; status を表す列）の分離を維持する必要があります。そうしないと、1 つの列の中に変数の種類が混在してしまう可能性があるからです（データ管理や整然データにおいて、一番「やってはいけないこと」です）。</p>

<p>上記では、ピボットによって日付列と文字列が 1 つの列の <code>value</code> に統合されています。R は列全体を文字型に変換することで対応し、日付の機能は失われています。</p>
<p>このような事態を防ぐには、元の列名の構文構造を利用します。このデータセットでは、観測番号、アンダースコア、そして “status” または “date” のいずれかを用いた共通の命名構造があります。この構文を利用して、ピボットした後にこれら 2 つのデータ型を別々の列に保持することが可能です。</p>
<p>この操作を行う手順は、以下の通りです。</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>names_to =</code> 引数に文字ベクトルを指定し、2 番目の項目に (<code>".value"</code>) を指定する。この特別な用語は、ピボットした列がその列名に含まれる文字に基づいて分割されることを示します。</p></li>
<li><p>また、<code>names_sep =</code> の引数には、「分割」する文字を指定する必要があります。ここでは、アンダースコア “_” です。</p></li>
</ul>
<p>このように、新しい列の命名と分割は、既存の列名のアンダースコア “_” を中心に行われる。</p>

<p>また、<strong>stringr</strong> パッケージの <code>str_remove_all()</code> を使用し、“obs” を削除して数値形式に変換することで、 <code>observation</code> 列も数字型（<code>numeric</code>）に変換できます（詳しくは、<a href="characters_strings.jp.html">文字型データ</a> の章をご参照ください）。</p>

<p>場合によっては、データセットを横長形式に変換したいことがあります。このような場合は、<code>pivot_wider()</code> 関数を使用します。</p>
<p>典型的な使用例としては、分析結果を読み手にとって理解しやすい形式（<a href="tables_presentation.jp.html">見やすい表の作り方</a> の章を参照）に変換する場合です。つまり、1 つの主題に関する情報が複数の行にまたがっているデータセットを、その情報が 1 つの行に格納される形式に変換することが必要な場合です。</p>
